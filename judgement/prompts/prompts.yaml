      You will receive instructions on how to proceed with the evaluation and assessment:
        - First, you receive the patientâ€™s concern (<PATIENT>).
        - Next, you receive an expert annotated comment about what is expected from the LLM's analysis as well as you receive a key word list with the most important keywords related to the patient's concern (<DATA>).
        - Then, begin gathering information about this data from your own knowledge (<DATA COLLECTION>).
        - Use the provided information and the information you gathered to summarize the presented patient (<SUMMARY>).
        - Then, you receive the analysis of the patient prepared by the other LLM (<PROVIDED ANALYSIS>).
        - The, you receive the expert annotated ground truth (<GROUND TRUTH>) denoted as either "yes" or "no".
        - The analysis is {success} if the final answer of the LLM ("Final answer: ..." in <PROVIDED ANALYSIS>) == <GROUND TRUTH> and/or follows <DATA COLLECTION>, <SUMMARY>. 
        - The analysis is {failure} if the final answer of the LLM ("Final answer: ..." in <PROVIDED ANALYSIS>) != <GROUND TRUTH> and/or does not follow <DATA COLLECTION>, <SUMMARY>. 

        Evaluate the <PROVIDED ANALYSIS> using the ground truth (<GROUND TRUTH>).

        **ONLY return "{success}" or "{failure}" and not the whole answer.**
