# Our Mission

We aim to provide a flexible and transparent framework for the application of
large language models (LLMs) in the realm of biomedical research and
applications. We put emphasis on an open-source process, which is vital to keep
up with the rapid pace of LLM development. This means we take great care to not
unnecessarily reimplement solutions that exist in the broader field, such as the
model chaining workflows provided by LangChain.

Rather, we look to provide an interface tuned towards the needs of the
biomedical community, with focus points on robustness in the face of
health-critical applications, native connectivity to [data
representations](/biocypher) used in biomedical research, and a
benchmark-forward approach to model evaluation in very specific use cases.

# Our Vision

Our developments have the overarching goal of making biomedical research more
productive by improving accessibility of technical workflows. Importantly, we
aim to automate low-level tasks to allow researchers to spend more time on
higher-level reasoning and data analysis without being burdened by the tedious
aspects of handling data and knowledge.

Inspired by the supportive role of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
in programming, we want to support research applications with an "Integrated
Research Environment" (IRE) in the longer term. The development of this system
cannot be done in isolation; if you are interested in contributing in any way,
please [get in touch](../../community/index.md)!
