title: BioChatter - Conversational AI for Biomedical Applications
description: A framework for deploying, testing, and evaluating conversational AI models in the biomedical domain.
---
# Home

Generative AI models have shown tremendous usefulness in increasing
accessibility and automation of a wide range of tasks. Yet, their application to
the biomedical domain is still limited, in part due to the lack of a common
framework for deploying, testing, and evaluating the diverse models and
auxiliary technologies that are needed. `biochatter` is a Python package
implementing a generic backend library for the connection of biomedical
applications to conversational AI. We describe the framework in [this
paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02534-3); for a more hands-on
experience, check out our two web app implementations:

    Agile framework in pure Python built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io),
    for fast prototyping and iteration.

    Advanced client-server architecture based on
    [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and
    [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

BioChatter is part of the [BioCypher](https://github.com/biocypher) ecosystem,
connecting natively to BioCypher knowledge graphs.

!!! tip "Hot Topics"

    BioChatter natively extends [BioCypher](https://biocypher.org) knowledge
    graphs. Check there for more information.

    We have also recently published a perspective on connecting knowledge and
    machine learning to enable causal reasoning in biomedicine, with a
    particular focus on the currently emerging "foundation models." You can read
    it [here](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44320-024-00041-w).

## Installation

To use the package, install it from PyPI, for instance using pip (`pip install
biochatter`) or Poetry (`poetry add biochatter`).

### Extras

The package has some optional dependencies that can be installed using the
following extras (e.g. `pip install biochatter[xinference]`):

- `xinference`: support for querying open-source LLMs through Xorbits Inference

- `ollama`: support for querying open-source LLMs through Ollama

- `podcast`: support for podcast text-to-speech (for the free Google TTS; the
paid OpenAI TTS can be used without this extra)

- `streamlit`: support for streamlit UI functions (used in BioChatter Light)
