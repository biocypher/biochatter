As a result, it often is not sensible to work on solutions that are subject to high company interests. For instance, early BioChatter developments included a workflow for automating podcast-like summaries of scientific papers; we discontinued this effort in light of later developments by Google to provide this same functionality inside their NotebookLM platform. We aim to continue to be mindful of this issue when deciding on which features to implement, which requires constant monitoring of the broader LLM ecosystem.</p>"},{"location":"about/project/","title":"Our Mission","text":"<p>We aim to provide a flexible and transparent framework for the application of large language models (LLMs) in the realm of biomedical research and applications.

Depending on the requirements of the application, this can be either trivial (\"Create a paragraph from these bullet points.\") or extremely complex (\"What is the driver of my patient's cancer?\"). Biomedical use cases tend to be biased towards the latter, often necessitating the integration of various sources of knowledge and quality assurance of the conversational system. As a result, BioChatter is not designed to function as a sole chatbot without integration of other data or knowledge; this functionality is provided by numerous companies.</p> <p>Instead, we at least include specific prompts that tune the LLM towards the desired application and user base, which can be configured by the developer implementing the application. More powerful applications are the focus however, including tool use (external software parameterisation), knowledge graph and vector database integration, multimodal inputs, and modular agentic workflows.</p>"},{"location":"about/use-cases/#graphical-user-interfaces","title":"Graphical user interfaces","text":"<p>Increasing accessibility to previously inaccessible functionality naturally implies that the developer needs to think about how to make the functionality available to the (by definition non-technical) user.

We need to constantly evaluate the multitude of combinations of individual models and versions, their parameters (e.g., temperature), prompt sets, databases and vector databases, and diverse application scenarios. To this end, we are maintaining a living benchmarking framework that allows us to continuously compare the performance of different models and configurations on a variety of tasks. The procedure of the living benchmark follows the idea of test-driven development, in that test cases are added with practical reference to a desired feature or behaviour. For cases where a model does not yield a perfect response out of the box, which will be most cases, modifications to the components of the framework, such as prompts or functions, are made to improve the model's performance. By tracking model performance on these tests over time, we can gain insights into the reliability of the framework and identify the gaps to be addressed.</p>"},{"location":"features/benchmark/#running-the-benchmark","title":"Running the benchmark","text":"<p>The benchmark uses the pytest framework to orchestrate the evaluation of a number of models on a number of tasks. The benchmark is run on a regular basis, and the results are published in the benchmark section. The benchmarking suite can be found in the <code>benchmark</code> directory of the BioChatter repository. It can be executed using standard pytest syntax, e.g., <code>poetry run pytest benchmark</code>. As default behavior it checks, which test cases have already been executed and only executes the tests that have not been executed yet. To run all benchmarks again, use <code>poetry run pytest benchmark --run-all</code>. If you want to develop and debug the benchmark instead of just running it, please refer to the developer docs.</p> <p>To allow flexible extension of the benchmark, we have implemeted a modular test framework that uses pytest fixtures to allow easy addition of new models and tasks. All setup is done in the <code>conftest.py</code> file in the <code>benchmark</code> directory. The benchmarks are organised by module, task, and subtask. Module names (e.g., <code>biocypher_query_generation</code> or <code>rag_interpretation</code>) group tasks by use case and are used to create benchmark dataset objects for the tests. Tasks (e.g., <code>entity_selection</code> or <code>query_generation</code>) are the actual tests that are executed in each module. The name of the test (minus the <code>test_</code> prefix) is used to generate the result file name. Subtasks (e.g., <code>single_word</code> or <code>multi_word</code>) are used to parametrise the tests and track the results of different subtasks in the result files. In addition, we generate md5 hashes of the test data for each subtask and use them to skip tests that have already been executed. Exemplary tests are defined in a YAML file in the <code>benchmark/data</code> directory, while the actual test dataset is encrypted and only available to the benchmarking pipeline. The result files are simple CSVs whose file names are generated from the name of the test function; they can be found in <code>benchmark/results</code> and contain scores for all executed combination of parameters.</p> <p>To achieve modularity, we use pytest fixtures and parametrization. For instance, to add a new model, we can modify the <code>OPENAI_MODEL_NAMES</code> and <code>XINFERENCE_MODELS</code> dictionary in <code>conftest.py</code>. The latter carries model names, sizes, format, and quantisations. The environment that runs the benchmark needs to make available all prerequisites for the different modules. For instance, the tasks requiring connection to an LLM need to provide the necessary credentials and API keys, or a connection to a self-hosted model. Likewise, the benchmarks of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) processes require a connection to the RAG agent, e.g., a vector database.</p>"},{"location":"features/benchmark/#calibration","title":"Calibration","text":"<p>To ensure valid assessment of LLM performance, we need to ensure calibration and technical validity of the benchmarking framework. More recent LLMs in particular may be problematic when using publicly available benchmark datasets, since they could have been used for training the model. This is particularly relevant in closed-source (e.g., OpenAI) models. Thus, we need to consider strategies for avoiding contamination, such as hand-crafting datasets, carefully testing for contamination, or using perturbation strategies to generate new datasets from existing ones. Advanced scenarios could utilise LLMs as \"examiners,\" allowing more flexible test design and free-form answers. There is much research into these phenomena, all of which should be considered in the maintenance of this testing framework.</p>"},{"location":"features/benchmark/#aspects-of-benchmarking","title":"Aspects of benchmarking","text":"<p>In the following, we will detail the different aspects of benchmarking that we are currently testing.

In the context of our work, there are two components we see as essential: data management (FAIR and transparent) and simple interfaces (driven by conversational AI). We will be using BioCypher and BioChatter for these two components.</p> <p>We will use a GitHub Project board (here) as the data source for our project management tool.

Mutations in CFTR are more commonly known for their role in cystic fibrosis. Individuals with cystic fibrosis have an increased risk of various cancers, including gastrointestinal cancers, but the link to ovarian cancer is not well-established.
