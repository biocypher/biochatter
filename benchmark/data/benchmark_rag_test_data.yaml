# Top-level keys: benchmark modules
# Values: list of dictionaries, each containing a test case
#
# Test case keys:
# - input (for creating the test)
# - expected (for asserting outcomes and generating a score)
# - case (for categorizing the test case)
#
# If any input is a dictionary itself, it will be expanded into separate test
# cases, using the top-level key to create a concatenated test case purpose.
