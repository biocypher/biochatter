# Top-level keys: benchmark modules
# Values: list of dictionaries, each containing a test case

# Test case keys:
# - input (for creating the test)

# - case (for categorizing the test case)

# If any input is a dictionary itself, it will be expanded into separate test
# cases, using the top-level key to create a concatenated test case purpose.
