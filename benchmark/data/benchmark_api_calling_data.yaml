# Top-level keys: benchmark modules
# Values: list of dictionaries, each containing a test case
#
# Test case keys:
# - input (for creating the test)
# - expected (for asserting outcomes and generating a score)
# - case (for categorizing the test case)
#
# If any input is a dictionary itself, it will be expanded into separate test
# cases, using the top-level key to create a concatenated test case purpose.
#
# We are using regular expressions to evaluate the expected parts, to be able to
# account for variations in the output (e.g. whitespace, capitalization). Make
# sure to escape special characters in the regular expressions, such as '?',
# '.', etc., by adding two backslashes before them.
