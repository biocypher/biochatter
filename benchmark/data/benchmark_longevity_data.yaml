The LLM could recommend optimized training intensities, strength training and routines to maintain good physical health and to achieve best longevity outcomes. The LLM should consider the risk of overtraining and recommend a healthy training balance (HIIT, resistance training, endurance). The individual could include relaxation techniques to reduce stress in the long-term. Supplements and further dietary interventions would be possible.
        The LLM should highlight that a frequent control of Vit. B12 and Iron levels might be an option, since the individual already follows a vegan diet without animal-based food. When attempting caloric restriction the individual should focus on the ingestion of a sufficient amount of these and other micronutrients, such as Vit. D and Iodine.

        The LLM should pay attention to the individual’s low adherence to past changes in dietary habits. Thus, it should recommend intermittent fasting/(m)ADF and exercise as a valuable alternative based on the individual’s history and behavioral profile.
        Regarding the irregular eating habits the LLM should optimize fasting protocols (time-schedules) which address the individual’s history and current lifestyle issues.
        Moreover, it should suggest coping strategies for managing cravings and mental hunger, such as a diet high in protein and fibers, thus, saturating meal alternatives. The LLM could also give examples for high caloric meals and snacks that might satisfy the individual’s cravings but are unhealthy in the long-term and thus should be avoided by the individual (soft drinks, chocolate bars, candies). 
        To help with long-term weight loss and the management of insulin sensitivity, blood sugar and inflammation the LLM should make exercise recommendations without overwhelming the individual. Regular Exercise could help with achieving long-term improvements; thus, not only with losing weight but also with a stable improvement of blood pressure, blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity. The individual could start with simple endurance exercises, for instance, walking or biking to work or developing a regular exercise routine in the free-time after work.

        The LLM could mention that the individual already has a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, healthy eating habits and good fitness. Thus, there might be no need for further supplementation with rapamycin or related supplements/drugs.
        However, the LLM should recognize that rapamycin is an experimental intervention with few resources and studies on its anti-aging effects in humans. It should consider the benefits of the mTOR inhibition induced by Rapamycin but also the potential risks of long-term medication (immunosuppression, glucose-intolerance).
        The LLM should consider and evaluate potential risks and contraindications for the individual. It should evaluate published dosage regimes and recommend strategies for long-term monitoring to minimize the risk of developing side effects. The LLM should include current scientific evidence, thereby suggesting that there are also alternatives such as metformin or even further lifestyle improvements (as low-risk interventions).
      key_words:
        - already healthy eating habits and regular exercise
        - potentially no need for further supplementation

        The LLM should recognise the (specific) combination of symptoms: fatigue, sudden weight gain despite unchanged dietary habits and frequent low-calorie diets, constipation, low mood. 
        Possible causes: hormonal imbalances, such as hypothyroidism; depression
        The individual should undergo further hormonal testing (TSH, Free T4, Anti-TPO/Anti-TGB). Caloric restriction alone won’t address the underlying hormone deficiency and in the case of n underlying hormonal imbalance, such as hypothyroidism, it may exacerbate the individual's symptoms, probably due to a decrease in T3, further decrease in metabolism and energy expenditure and it might worsen fatigue and muscle weakness when not performed properly. If the individual is diagnosed with an underlying disease, the individual would need to be treated with an appropriate hormone replacement therapy and/or other possible case specific therapies (e.g. in the case of a psychological disorder) before attempting caloric restriction interventions.
        However, the LLM could mention that regular exercise can bring new energy. Little steps towards a regular habit of movement can already have great positive impacts, e.g. riding to work with a bike, regular walking. 
        The LLM could explain that the individual’s symptoms may not only be related to lifestyle or aging processes in order to prevent further frustration and to empower the individual to seek proper diagnosis and treatment.

        The LLM should recognize that Mediterranean diet (or a similar diet rich in polyphenols or the DASH diet [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]) may help managing Rheumatoid Arthritis (here: EORA) or chronic inflammatory (metabolic) diseases, respectively. In comparison to their younger counterparts, individuals with EORA often show unusual symptoms such as higher incidence of rheumatoid factor and higher frequency of bone erosions. EORA can present itself in multiple types 1 and is often characterized by a disease onset after the age of 60 and in rare cases disease onset can be shifted towards even higher age.
        The LLM could create a list which highlights how such a diet could help (by its effects on cardiovascular health, metabolism, …)  and could recommend supplementations (e.g. omega-3). It should also give a brief summary about potential interaction effects between the attended dietary regimen with current medication.

        Given that the individual does not provide information on a potentially existing Heart Failure, ejection fraction or device implantations, it would be best practice for the LLM to recommend supervised medium intensity training or supervised cardiac rehabilitation programs. 
        Intervention studies and meta analyses showed a beneficial effect of post MI HIIT training in individuals with HFmrEF and HFpEF (Heart Failure with mildly reduced and preserved Ejection Fraction, respectively) or low-risk individuals, whereas other studies showed no superior effects to MCE (moderate continuous training) in HFrEF.  HIIT can improve VO2peak or exercise capacity in post-MI individuals and is considered safe when performed under supervision (cardiovascular rehabilitation program). However, the “2020 ESC Guidelines on sports cardiology and exercise in individuals with cardiovascular disease” recommends HIIT (only) for low-risk individuals (pp. 44-45).
        Thus, the LLM should recommend training under supervision after the individual underwent a thorough baseline evaluation of his cardiovascular condition 5. The initial training regimen could consist of moderate continuous exercise training (MCE) combined with frequent aerobic exercise and resistance training.

        The LLM should offer clear dietary plans for managing chronic gout and lowering serum uric acid levels. One recommendation could or should be a low-purine diet: reduction in red meat, avoidance of sugary food and drinks and alcohol. The diet should be rich in vegetables, whole grains and (basic) fruits. Assuming that dietary changes were recommended before but obviously these were not implemented, the LLM should make specific suggestions about which diet changes may provide the highest returns with the lowest investments, or which motivational aids may help implementing dietary change. 
        The individual should induce weight loss through gradual increases in exercise, also to improve a potential insulin resistance which could additionally help with managing uric acid levels. The individual's uric acid levels should be monitored on a regular basis.

        For this individual the LLM should recognize that starting with HIIT training is contraindicated due to the individual's characteristics: elevated resting heart rate, elevated resting blood pressure, and clear signs of a poorly controlled Heart Failure: ankle swelling (edema), shortness of breath and muscle fatigue. When attempting HIIT without baseline evaluation by a specialized physician and/or without professional supervision the individual might face a high risk for developing even more severe symptoms and an exacerbation or decompensation of his Heart Failure.
        The LLM could recommend supervised moderate training with focus on moderate aerobic exercises or resistance training after thorough evaluation by a physician and treatment of the present symptoms and issues. Only when the individual's response to the intervention is positive (managed blood pressure, heart rate etc.) the intensity could be increased under supervision and frequent health monitoring.

        Possible causes: hormonal imbalances, such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), underlying psychological conditions (such as depression), hypothyroidism etc.
        The LLM should mention that caloric restriction (or other dietary interventions) won’t sufficiently address the underlying hormonal disbalance. The LLM could recommend further diagnostic testing (LH/FSH ratio, DHEA-s, Testosterone, thyroid hormones) and additional consultations with an endocrinologist and/or gynecologist.
        When diagnosed with an underlying disease the individual should undergo a specific treatment before attempting the desired dietary interventions that could also promote recovery; such as a diet consisting of food with a low glycemic index (low GI) and food that is rich in fibers, complex carbohydrates (e.g. whole grain) and healthy fats (e.g. unsaturated fatty acids, balanced omega-3:omega-6 ratio). The individual could start with a moderate decrease in caloric intake. The individual could combine these interventions with daily physical activity and a regular monitoring of biomarkers.

        The LLM should acknowledge that the individual is already engaged in keeping his lifestyle healthy and active.
        The LLM should present an evaluation of the current research on spermidine and its supplementation in healthy human individuals due to the scarcity of large-scale human intervention studies and the resulting knowledge gap of spermidine’s effects during long-term use. It could give a summary on how spermidine is thought to exert its proposed positive effects on organisms and their healthspan (oxidative stress, metabolism, molecular level [hypunisation, eIF5a], autophagy, …). The LLM should check whether there are intervention studies with people in a similar age range, etc, as the individual here.
        The LLM should inform about potential side-effects and interactions and possible recommended dosage regimens. It could also suggest regular monitoring for side effects. It could also provide an overview about how the individual could easily increase spermidine intake with dietary interventions.

The LLM should focus on exercises that support muscle-building, balance and reduce fracture risk as well as the risk for falls. It could recommend resistance training, moderate training with weights (walking, stair climbing) and/or training which supports overall body balance (yoga, pilates, tai chi). Initially, the exercises should be performed under supervision.
        Beside a balanced training regimen the individual could benefit from a diet rich in protein, micronutrients and minerals such as Calcium and Vitamin D and which also consists of anti-inflammatory foods (vegetables, healthy fats).

        It is important that the LLM identifies the individual’s slight iron deficiency (ferritin below normal, transferrin saturation and hemoglobin lower limit). Caloric restriction diets and intermittent fasting regimes could exacerbate the individual’s iron deficiency, if the individual does not consume enough iron-containing foods.
        The individual should postpone the planned interventions and should try to increase the intake of foods which contain a sufficient amount of iron. The LLM could recommend foods rich in heme iron or rich in non-heme iron combined with foods rich in Vitamin C or Vitamin C supplementation. Together with her healthcare provider the individual should consider proper iron supplementation.
        Iron deficiency can have multiple causes. Causes could be an already unbalanced diet, bleeding in GI tract, likely due to high intake of Aspirin and related drugs, heavy menstrual bleeding. 
        The LLM could provide adapted dietary plans for intermittent fasting with a focus on iron-rich foods. The individual should avoid nutrients that potentially decrease iron absorption (dairy products, tannin-rich food or drinks). Iron levels and body weight (preferably waist-hip-ratio)  should be monitored by a physician for tracking long-term improvements or worsening. If the iron levels remain low during the interventions the individual should reduce the intensity of the regimens or even stop them in order to prevent further worsening of her condition.

It could provide an overview of Fisetin’s proposed positive effects on the clearance of senescent cells, inflammation, ROS levels and cognitive health. The LLM should highlight that Fisetin is generally considered safe (example dosage regimens) but the lack of studies carried out in humans makes it difficult to estimate long-term effects of Fisetin supplementation. Thus, the individual should monitor for side-effects and potential interactions with current medications. The LLM should point out that for many supplements, their quality is questionable; frequently the labels do not match the ingredients found by independent inspections.
        The LLM could recommend additional lifestyle changes, such as a regular healthy diet, regular exercise (strength, resistance or aerobic/anaerobic training as long as considered safe by the individual’s healthcare provider) and/or a healthy sleep hygiene etc.

The LLM could suggest sources of protein such as fish, eggs, dairy products, … The LLM may suggest protein primarily from plant sources.
        Instead of trying to improve health by protein restriction the individual should attempt moderate exercise regimens appropriate for building and maintaining muscle and bone mass.

        Before any recommendation on supplementation, the LLM should consider an examination of the individual. Since the individual already has a too high BMI, slightly elevated blood pressure and borderline Triglycerides as well as the individual suffers from fatigue, the LLM could suggest aiming for a weight reduction and for the implementation of regular exercise. The mentioned fatigue could also be a sign for an underlying disease, whether physiological or psychological.
        The LLM should provide an overview of the scientific evidence and research proposing Epicatechin as an “exercise mimetic” and valuable supplements in terms of longevity medicine (cardiovascular health, muscle health, cognitive health). The LLM could propose published safe dosage regimens and recommend monitoring for possible side-effects.
        The LLM should highlight that the supplementation of Epicatechin (or any other exercise mimetic) alone won’t fully reduce or prevent causes of a sedentary lifestyle, although the interaction between exercise and geroprotection needs to be elucidated. The individual should include regular exercise (aerobic training, moderate intensity or HIIT training, …) and should focus on a healthy and balanced diet with natural sources of Epicatechin and anti-inflammatory nutrients.
        If needed and/or wished the individual could consider regular monitoring of metabolic, cardiovascular markers or other biomarkers.
        As already mentioned, the main focus should be on achieving weight loss and regular activity before trying to solve the accompanying health issues with supplementation with Epicatechin or related supplements.
