        The LLM should suggest and optimize a caloric restriction and exercise regimen to maximize potential health, health-and lifespan benefits. It should further recommend an appropriate caloric intake for the intervention based on the individual’s metabolic characteristics/markers. The LLM could also make suggestions for specific meal plans or dietary interventions, respectively (unprocessed food, meals low in sugar, fat, high in protein and fibers).  
        Suggestions for further personalized interventions, such as the combination of caloric restriction and appropriate exercise regimens could be possible. The LLM may comment on motivational issues as the subject sounds like a person who understands the metabolic issues but may be weak when it comes to behavioral changes.

        The individual is young and healthy and could benefit from moderate caloric restriction and/or additional exercise. The LLM could recommend optimized training intensities, strength training and routines to maintain good physical health and to achieve best longevity outcomes. The LLM should consider the risk of overtraining and recommend a healthy training balance (HIIT, resistance/strength training, endurance). The individual could include relaxation techniques to reduce stress in the long-term. Supplements and further dietary interventions would be possible.
        The LLM should highlight that a frequent control of Vit. B12 and iron levels is an option, since the individual already follows a vegan diet without animal-based food. When attempting caloric restriction, the individual should focus on the ingestion of a sufficient amount of these and other micronutrients, such as Vit. D and iodine.

        A personalized exercise and *regular/balanced* meal plan with focus on bone and muscle health and prevention of further weight, muscle and bone loss should be recommended. The LLM might further recommend suitable training intensities and frequencies, such as moderate resistance training. The meal plans should contain appropriate amounts of protein (the individual might consider renal function testing), essential micronutrients and feature fixed meal times. The LLM might ask how libido and testosterone levels have developed in the last year and in the last five years.

        The LLM should pay attention to the individual’s low adherence to past changes in dietary habits. Thus, it should recommend intermittent fasting/modified ADF and exercise as a valuable alternative based on the individual’s history and behavioral profile.
        Regarding the irregular eating habits the LLM should optimize fasting protocols (time-schedules) which address the individual’s history and current lifestyle issues.
        Moreover, it should suggest coping strategies for managing cravings and mental hunger, such as a diet high in protein and fibers, thus, saturating meal alternatives. The LLM could also give examples for high caloric meals and snacks that might satisfy the individual’s cravings but are unhealthy in the long-term and thus should be avoided by the individual (soft drinks, chocolate bars, candies). 
        To help with long-term weight loss and the management of insulin sensitivity, blood sugar and inflammation, the LLM should make exercise recommendations without overwhelming the individual. Regular exercise could help with achieving long-term improvements; thus, not only with losing weight but also with a stable improvement of blood pressure, blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity. The individual could start with simple endurance exercises, for instance, walking or biking to work or developing a regular exercise routine in the free-time after work.

      summary: |-
        The LLM could mention that the individual already has a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, healthy eating habits and good fitness. Thus, there might be no need for further supplementation with rapamycin or related supplements/drugs.
        Moreover, the LLM should recognize that rapamycin is an experimental intervention with few resources and studies on its anti-aging effects in humans. It should consider the benefits of the mTOR inhibition induced by Rapamycin but also the potential risks of long-term medication (immunosuppression, glucose-intolerance).
        The LLM should consider and evaluate potential risks and contraindications for the individual. It should evaluate published dosage regimes and recommend strategies for long-term monitoring to minimize the risk of developing side effects. The LLM should include current scientific evidence, thereby suggesting that there are also alternatives such as metformin or even further lifestyle improvements (as low-risk interventions).

        The LLM should recognize that Mediterranean diet (or a similar diet rich in polyphenols or the DASH diet [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]) may help managing Rheumatoid Arthritis (here: EORA) or chronic inflammatory (metabolic) diseases, respectively. In comparison to their younger counterparts, individuals with EORA often show unusual symptoms such as higher incidence of rheumatoid factor and higher frequency of bone erosions. EORA can present itself in multiple types and is often characterized by a disease onset after the age of 60 and in rare cases disease onset can be shifted towards even higher age.
        The LLM could create a list which highlights how such a diet could help (by its effects on cardiovascular health, metabolism, …)  and could recommend supplementations (e.g. omega-3). It should also give a brief summary about potential interaction effects between the attended dietary regimen with current medication.

        Given that the individual does not provide information on a potentially existing Heart Failure, ejection fraction or device implantations, it would be best practice for the LLM to recommend supervised medium intensity training or supervised cardiac rehabilitation programs. 
        Intervention studies and meta analyses showed a beneficial effect of post MI HIIT training in individuals with HFmrEF and HFpEF (Heart Failure with mildly reduced and preserved Ejection Fraction, respectively) or low-risk individuals, whereas other studies showed no superior effects to MCE (moderate continuous training) in HFrEF. HIIT can improve VO2peak or exercise capacity in post-MI individuals and is considered safe when performed under supervision (cardiovascular rehabilitation program). However, the “2020 ESC Guidelines on sports cardiology and exercise in individuals with cardiovascular disease” recommends HIIT (only) for low-risk individuals (pp. 44-45).
        Thus, the LLM should recommend training under supervision after the individual underwent a thorough baseline evaluation of his cardiovascular condition. The initial training regimen could consist of moderate continuous exercise training (MCE) combined with frequent aerobic exercise and resistance training.

        The LLM should recognize the combination of symptoms: unexpected and sudden as well as progressive weight gain, joint pain (particularly in wrist and knee [compression]), facial changes, hypertension and elevated fasting glucose levels. 
        Possible causes: hormonal imbalances, most likely excess in growth hormone; but also incorrect execution of past dietary interventions (e.g. exhaustion due to too restrictive eating), since the individual mentions failed caloric restriction regimens.
        Thus, the LLM should inform about hormonal imbalances that could cause the individual's symptoms and that these symptoms cannot be addressed by caloric restriction alone.
        The individual should undergo a comprehensive diagnostic carried out by an endocrinologist (hormonal panel for GH/IGF-1/GHRH, OGT, but also sex hormones, thyroid hormones) and other specialists for further examination (organomegaly, especially cardiomegaly) before going for lifestyle interventions that could even worsen the individual’s current health status.

        The LLM should recognize that the combination of osteoporosis and sarcopenia (osteosarcopenia) requires a therapy and regimen that addresses both bone density loss and decline in muscle mass. The LLM should focus on exercises that support muscle-building, balance and reduce fracture risk as well as the risk for falls. It could recommend resistance training, moderate training with weights (walking, stair climbing) and/or training which supports overall body balance (yoga, pilates, tai chi). Initially, the exercises should be performed under supervision.
        Beside a balanced training regimen the individual could benefit from a diet rich in protein, micronutrients and minerals such as Calcium and Vitamin D and which also consists of anti-inflammatory foods (vegetables, healthy fats).

Caloric restriction diets and intermittent fasting regimes could exacerbate the individual’s iron deficiency, if the individual does not consume enough iron-containing foods.

The LLM could recommend foods rich in heme iron or rich in non-heme iron combined with foods rich in Vitamin C or Vitamin C supplementation. Together with her healthcare provider the individual should consider proper iron supplementation.
        Iron deficiency can have multiple causes. Causes could be an already unbalanced diet, bleeding in GI tract, likely due to high intake of Aspirin and related drugs, heavy menstrual bleeding. 
        The LLM could provide adapted dietary plans for intermittent fasting with a focus on iron-rich foods. The individual should avoid nutrients that potentially decrease iron absorption (dairy products, tannin-rich food or drinks). Iron levels and body weight (preferably waist-hip-ratio) should be monitored by a physician for tracking long-term improvements or worsening. If the iron levels

        While protein restriction is believed to exert positive effects in younger individuals (and animal models) it is considered contraindicated in elderly comorbid individuals (here: sarcopenia, hypertension, osteoporosis). Thus, a restriction in daily protein intake could cause an exacerbation of the individual’s already low baseline muscle mass and bone mineral density, thereby increasing the risk of a fulminant osteoporosis and risk and falls, respectively. 
        The individual should lay his focus on consuming a sufficient amount of protein to maintain muscle mass and to prevent further decline in muscle mass and bone health. The LLM could suggest sources of protein such as fish, eggs, dairy products, … The LLM may suggest protein primarily from plant sources.
        Instead of trying to improve health by protein restriction the individual should attempt moderate exercise regimens appropriate for building and maintaining muscle and bone mass. Regular function assessments, monitoring for muscle and bone health and long-term monitoring of inflammatory markers could be an option for tracking the individual’s condition in the long-term.

        Before any recommendation on supplementation, the LLM should consider an examination of the individual. Since the individual already has a too high BMI, slightly elevated blood pressure, borderline triglycerides and fatigue, the LLM could suggest aiming for a weight reduction and for the implementation of regular exercise. The mentioned fatigue could also be a sign for an underlying disease, whether physiological or psychological.
        The LLM should provide an overview of the scientific evidence and research proposing Epicatechin as an “exercise mimetic” and may mention other valuable supplements considered in longevity medicine (cardiovascular health, muscle health, cognitive health). The LLM could propose published safe dosage regimens and recommend monitoring for possible side-effects.
        The LLM should highlight that the supplementation of Epicatechin (or any other exercise mimetic) alone won’t fully reduce or prevent causes of a sedentary lifestyle, although the interaction between exercise and geroprotection needs to be elucidated. The individual should include regular exercise (aerobic training, moderate intensity or HIIT training, …) and should focus on a healthy and balanced diet with natural sources of Epicatechin and anti-inflammatory nutrients.
        If needed and/or wished the individual could consider regular monitoring of metabolic, cardiovascular markers or other biomarkers.

        Open-Access-URL: https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.100481
        Authors: Tucci, Tucci
        Excerpt: Caloric restriction (CR), that is limiting food intake, is recognized in mammals as the best characterized and most reproducible strategy for extending lifespan, retarding physiological aging and delaying the onset of age-associated diseases. Restricted calorie intake modifies the rate of aging and cellular pathology, reduces the age-associated accumulation of oxidatively damaged proteins, lipids and DNA and also prevents many of the changes in gene expression and transcriptional activity that normally occur with ageing. Although several theories have been advanced over the years to explain the anti-ageing effects of CR, one favoured hypothesis is that CR acts by decreasing oxidative stress. Biologically, different animal species are characterised by markedly different lifespan. For example, mice have relatively short (around 2-year) mean longevity, whereas humans live to a mean of 70-80 years. Animals with higher metabolic rates often have shorter life spans. The higher the metabolic rate of an organism, the greater the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hence the shorter the lifespan; however, in some species the strict correlation between metabolic rate and life span is not maintained. Birds and primates, for example, tend to live longer than would be predicted by their metabolic rates. This is because, at a given metabolic rate, mitochondria from these species tend to produce fewer ROS. Thus the accumulation of molecular damage and the resulting increase of oxidative stress caused by ROS was thought to contribute to aging rather than metabolic rate itself and provided the strongest correlation with overall longevity. More recently, however, became evident that the ROS model cannot be the only driving-force of aging. No animal lives long enough to experience the consequences of damage by ROS, since other factors terminate its life first.

        Excerpt: "Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention in which calorie intake is reduced without malnutrition. CR is consid-ered the most robust nongenetic method for increasing life span and has been shown to be effective in yeast, worms, flies, mice, rats, and nonhuman primates. CR induces a host of physiological changes, including reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduced core body temperature, and reduced global cell proliferation rates. It is unknown whether these physiological effects are connected to the CR-dependent prevention of age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease in mammalian model systems. Beyond the prevention of disease, CR reduces age-related declines in cognitive function and the development of sarcopenia. Although CR-dependent reductions in disease and increased longevity were first demonstrated in rats 75 years ago, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not fully understood. Two apparently contradictory mechanisms have been proposed to explain how CR reduces the accumulation of damaged proteins: 1) increased protein replacement resulting in less oxidative damage, or 2) decreased protein turnover due to lower demand for protein replacement. The first suggests that CR is similar to short-term starvation, which induces autophagy and lysosomal proteolysis in cells. Several researchers have reported that chronic CR increases protein degradation, including autophagic digestion of mitochondria, removing damaged proteins while increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and replacement with new proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, CR-dependent increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and increased autophagy or protein catabolism have been reported. Yet, to date, no study has assessed the turnover of autophagic substrates (e.g. mitochondrial proteins) in calorie-restricted mammals."

        Excerpt: "Physical exercise is among the ways by which muscles may be protected against disease-induced muscle wasting. Physical activity can be grossly divided into two types: aerobic (or endurance) and anaerobic (or strength) exercise. The former shifts muscle fiber types toward those with increased capacity for aerobic metabolism and better ability to resist fatigue, due to a larger number of mitochondria and vessels (types I and IIA fibers), this is typical in runners, long-distance cross-country skiers, bicyclists, swimmers. These fibers contract slowly with a low peak force and generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids. The second type of exercise causes hypertrophy, especially of myofibers IIX (and IIB in rodents), due to enhanced synthesis of contractile proteins, resulting in increased strength with no change in the number of mitochondria (typically occurring in weight-lifters and body-builders). These fibers generate fast contractions with a high peak force, and metabolize phosphocreatine and glucose anaerobically to make ATP. Aerobic exercise induces in humans and in rodents the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1-α). PGC1-α not only promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, contrasting the propensity to fatigue of cachectic muscles, but also directly antagonizes protein catabolism by blocking FoxO3, the master transcription factor coordinating both proteasomal and lysosomal protein degradation. As a result, oxidative fibers are more resistant to cancer-induced atrophy than glycolytic ones, typically enlarged upon muscle adaptation to anaerobic exercise."

        Excerpt: Osteoporosis is a chronic systemic bone disease due to an impairment of the balance between bone formation and resorption. This disease is characterized by loss of bone mass, microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, and an increased risk of fractures. Pain and other complications can reduce a patient's ability to engage in activities of daily living and can be associated with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. The continuous increase in life expectancy inevitably leads to an increase in diseases, especially senile osteoporosis, and the economic burden of osteoporosis-related fractures is significant. Despite the numerous therapeutic approaches currently available, there has recently been an increased demand for complementary, alternative, and natural medicine including antioxidants in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Understanding the effects of oxidative stress (OS) on the biological factors responsible for the development of osteoporosis and discovering the effects of natural antioxidants on the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis may lead to an improvement in the therapeutic management of this chronic disease that is so widespread worldwide. Many studies have described that OS negatively impacts the bone remodeling process, causing a reduction in bone mineral, the recruitment and activation of mature osteoclasts, which remove damaged bone and produce essential factors for neoangiogenesis such as vascular growth factor. Osteocyte apoptosis occurs following bone matrix microdamage that induces disruption of the network; in fact, under this condition, levels of oxygen, nutrients, and factors essential for the viability of osteocytes are reduced, with consequent metabolic alterations and OS formation. OS and osteocyte apoptosis can also occur following other physical, hormonal, and proinflammatory signals due to estrogen deficiency or an increase in factors such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-11 in bone fluid.

        Excerpt: Sarcopenia (from the Greek sarx = flesh, penia = scarcity) is a complex geriatric syndrome associated with the loss of muscle mass and reduced muscle strength. Sarcopenia can be defined as primary or secondary. In the first case, it is a sole consequence of aging, while secondary sarcopenia has a multifactorial etiology, and include as possible causes the decline in physical activity, alterations of the endocrine system, presence of comorbidities, inflammation, insulin resistance and nutritional inadequacy. However, in a clinical setting characterized by prevalent older subjects, both age-related and diseases related factors play a role in the development of sarcopenia. Reduced muscle strength leads to a reduction in muscle performance, and is a major cause of disability, mortality and other adverse outcomes. The 2010 European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People recognized for the first time that muscle strength is also an important component of sarcopenia. The group defined the syndrome as a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, increasing the risk for the development of physical disability, poor quality of life and death. Despite being primarily considered a natural part of aging, the degree of muscle loss is highly variable and depends on the presence of some risk factors. Muscle homeostasis is maintained thanks to a fine balance between the formation of new myocytes, hypertrophy and protein catabolism. This equilibrium is controlled by the nervous, endocrine and immune systems, and is highly affected by nutrition and physical activity. Lack of exercise is believed to be the most important risk factor for the development of secondary sarcopenia.

        Excerpt: The importance of balanced nutrition in older adults has been recognized for a long time, but only recently have studies been designed to explore the effects of nutrition on muscle mass and physical performance. These studies suggest that diet has an important role in the prevention and management of sarcopenia and several kinds of interventions have been tested. The nutrients that have been most closely linked to the development of sarcopenia and frailty are protein, vitamin D, antioxidant nutrients (like carotenoids, selenium, and vitamins E and C), and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The few studies performed to date seem to indicate that there is a protective role of protein supplementation against frailty syndrome and it is tempting to suggest daily 30 g protein supplements help to prevent frailty. However, it is well established that excess protein can also be harmful; therefore, specific individual characteristics should be considered before prescribing these supplements. On the other hand, the relevance of other nutritional interventions, such as vitamin D, omega-3, and medium-chain triglycerides, is much more scarcely researched in the literature. Therefore, new clinical trials are necessary to carry out effective nutritional interventions to prevent frailty development. Pharmacological therapies for the prevention and treatment of frailty are represented by drugs used to control both osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Anti-osteoporotic agents are used to increase bone mass and reduce fracture risk, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, and teriparatide, associated with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Advanced age is associated with increased signaling through extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in skeletal myocytes, favoring the development of sarcopenia.

        Excerpt: Sarcopenia diagnosis is present with low muscle mass, low muscle strength, and low physical performance. The skeletal muscle index is calculated as the ratio between free fat mass of arms and legs (kg)/height (m^2), and the cut-off is 7.26 kg/ m^2 for men and 5.5 kg/m^2 for women. Strength is measured by the handgrip test, with the cut-off assigned as less than 30 kg for men and less than 20 kg for women. In the elderly, dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry analysis is utilized to measure osteoporosis, which is directly linked to visceral adipose tissue, waist/hip ratio, trunk to leg fat mass ratio, and fat mass index. The current recommendations for diets of older people include the use of proteins to protect muscles; they should aim for a daily average intake of 1.0-1.2 g/kg body weight (BW)/d. There is also a recommended target of 25-30 g of protein per meal, with ~2.5-2.8 g of leucine, the most potent stimulator of muscle protein synthesis. More research is needed to define the exact protein needs in this frail and complex population, who often also experience vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25OHD] lower than ng/mL). This is due to several causes, including unbalanced diet, malabsorption, lack of exposure to sunlight, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, and the use of drugs. Eighty percent of vitamin D content derives from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and only 20% from food and dietary supplements. For example, 5 mL of cod liver oil contains ~400 International Units (IU) of vitamin D, while exposing the body to sunlight may result in the production of 10,000-25,000 IU. On the other hand, diet plays an important role in optimizing vitamin D concentration both in the mid-winter season and in the regions with moderate and high latitudes, characterized by low solar exposure and cold temperatures. Vitamin D levels, as reflected by serum 25OHD levels, are genetically highly regulated.

        Excerpt: In an effort to circumvent the complexity of counting calories and avoid the side effects associated with caloric restriction, other forms of dietary restriction with food intake limited to a daily time window, such as intermittent fasting and alternate day fasting, have been proposed. Accordingly, different lengths of eating and fasting periods have been tested, with the most common reported of 16/8 h of fasting and eating intervals, respectively. Longer fasting periods of 24 h followed by ad-libitum food intake for 24 h are also practiced and known as alternate-day fasting. Although intermittent fasting and alternate-day fasting are not as well-studied as caloric restriction, emerging evidence suggests that they are more tolerable and their side effects are less prominent than in caloric restriction and, thus, both dietary interventions could represent promising and more feasible strategies to curtail the hypercaloric pandemic in the Western societies. To this end, a study comparing the efficacy of caloric restriction and intermittent fasting (restricted to 2 days a week) in obese diabetic patients at risk of cardiovascular disease showed that both regimens reduce body weight and HbA1c levels, a measure of long-term blood glucose control. Consistently, another small observational study on obese subjects with diabetes mellitus type 2 and receiving metformin reported that shortterm intermittent fasting effectively reduces body weight and improves morning glucose levels. Interestingly, 6 out of 10 participants in this study described that intermittent fasting is highly tolerable, and reported readiness to follow intermittent fasting after study completion. Of note, intermittent fasting was capable to improve health parameters in healthy, male athletes. Specifically, intermittent fasting reduced body fat mass without worsening body fat-free mass, muscle area and strength.

        Excerpt: By contrast, the InterFast trial showed that alternate-day fasting is capable of improving cardiometabolic markers in healthy non-obese subjects, including reduced body weight, fat-to-lean ratio, and LDL-cholesterol. Furthermore, alternate-day fasting increases ketone bodies (on fasting and non-fasting days), and reduces the inflammatory marker sICAM-1, suggesting that alternate-day fasting is a viable dietary adaptation also for nonobese individuals. Importantly, this 4-week long intervention trial reported no adverse effects on immunity or bone density. In sum, a growing body of evidence indicates potential cardiovascular benefits of intermittent and alternate-day fasting. However, it is still not clear whether these nutritional regimens, wherein food intake is limited to a consistent timerestricted interval without changes in nutritional quality or quantity, confer a significantly better adherence than caloric restriction. Also, it remains elusive whether the cardiometabolic benefits of these regimens can be applied to the general healthy population or specific groups with disorders, such as obese individuals with metabolic disease. Hence, larger studies, preferably with long-term follow-up, will be required to address these open issues. Recent years have seen an increasing interest in fasting, mimicking diets and caloric restriction, which might offer a more feasible alternative to stringent forms of fasting. For example, a randomized clinical trial was designed to investigate the effects of fasting mimicking diets, which are low in carbohydrates and protein and high in unsaturated fats, on cardiovascular disease and risk factors, including aging and diabetes mellitus type 2. The authors observed that practicing low calorie fasting mimicking diet for only 5 consecutive days per month results in a reduction of body mass index (BMI), arterial blood pressure, fasting glucose, and IGF-1 levels.

        Authors: Coletti, Stevenson Moylan, Berardi, Piccirillo
        Excerpt: "Physical exercise is among the ways by which muscles may be protected against disease-induced muscle wasting. Physical activity can be grossly divided into two types: aerobic (or endurance) and anaerobic (or strength) exercise. The former shifts muscle fiber types toward those with increased capacity for aerobic metabolism and better ability to resist fatigue, due to a larger number of mitochondria and vessels (types I and IIA fibers), this is typical in runners, long-distance cross-country skiers, bicyclists, swimmers. These fibers contract slowly with a low peak force and generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids. The second type of exercise causes hypertrophy, especially of myofibers IIX (and IIB in rodents), due to enhanced synthesis of contractile proteins, resulting in increased strength with no change in the number of mitochondria (typically occurring in weight-lifters and body-builders). These fibers generate fast contractions with a high peak force, and metabolize phosphocreatine and glucose anaerobically to make ATP. Aerobic exercise induces in humans and in rodents the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1-α). PGC1-α not only promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, contrasting the propensity to fatigue of cachectic muscles, but also directly antagonizes protein catabolism by blocking FoxO3, the master transcription factor coordinating both proteasomal and lysosomal protein degradation. As a result, oxidative fibers are more resistant to cancer-induced atrophy than glycolytic ones, typically enlarged upon muscle adaptation to anaerobic exercise."

The SENECA study of 2600 elderly people in Europe born 1913-1918 and studied over 10 years starting in 1988, reported that a healthy lifestyle at older ages (70+ years) is able to delay the deterioration of health status and reduces mortality (de Groot et al 2004).

        Excerpt: Rapamycin is a macrocyclic antibiotic that was first discovered in samples of soil from Rapa Nui, Easter Island, collected in 1965. It was isolated from the cultures of S. hygroscopicus from this sample in the 1970s. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved rapamycin for the prevention of acute rejection in kidney transplantation, the treatment of fibrous skin tumors of tuberous sclerosis, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and rapamycin-eluting stents for the reduction of restenosis. Rapamycin and its analogs inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the major driver of the aging process. The mTOR interacts with several proteins to form two distinct types of multiprotein complexes, named mTOR complexes 1 and 2 (mTORc1 and mTORc2). Rapamycin inhibits mTORc1, but when given chronically, it inhibits mTORc2. Moreover, inhibition of mTORc1 with rapamycin and its analogs has been shown to extend lifespan and attenuate aging and disease progression in multiple organs of various model organisms. Therefore, rapamycin and its analogs are potential repurpose drug candidates for geroprotection in humans. The Greek word "αναλογια," also called "analogia" in Latin, is used to describe a similarity in natural sciences [8]. Accordingly, an analog is a drug that shares chemical and pharmacological similarities with an existing drug. Analogs can be classified into direct analogs (sharing both chemical and pharmacological characteristics), also known as the "me-too" drugs; structural analogs (sharing only chemical characteristics); and functional analogs (having different chemical characteristics but similar pharmacological properties) with the "parent" drug. Rapamycin inhibits the mTOR kinase by binding to FK506-binding proteins (FKBP), and its analogs have a similar chemical structure that only differs in the functional group present at carbon-40.

        Title: Hypothalamic mTORC2 is essential for metabolic health and longevity
        Open-Access-URL: https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/acel.13014
        Authors: Chellappa, Brinkman, Mukherjee, Morrison, Alotaibi, Carbajal, Alhadeff, Isaac, Perron, Yao, Cole, Purdy, Defelice, Wakai, Tomasiewicz, Lin, Meyer, Peng, Arriola Apelo, Puglielli, Betley, Georgios, Paschos, Baur, Dudley, Lamming, Correspondence, Baur, Lamming
        Excerpt: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays critical roles in the regulation of growth, metabolism, and aging. The mTOR protein kinase is found in two distinct protein complexes; mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates numerous environmental and hormonal cues, including the availability of amino acids (Wolfson & Sabatini, 2017), to regulate key anabolic processes including ribosomal biogenesis, protein translation, and autophagy, while mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) plays a role in cytoskeletal organization and is a key effector of insulin/PI3K signaling (Kennedy & Lamming, 2016; Zhou & Huang, 2011). The pharmaceutical rapamycin, which acutely and robustly inhibits mTORC1, extends the lifespan in organisms including yeast, worms, flies, and mice, even when begun late in life or when treatment is intermittent (Apelo, Pumper, Baar, Cummings, & Lamming, 2016; Bitto et al., 2016; Bjedov et al., 2010; Dumas & Lamming, 2019; Hansen et al., 2007; Harrison et al., 2009; Kapahi et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2011; Powers, Kaeberlein, Caldwell, Kennedy, & Fields, 2006; Robida-Stubbs et al., 2012; Selman et al., 2009). While it has long been presumed that inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin mediates its beneficial effects on longevity, we and others have found that prolonged treatment with rapamycin also inhibits mTORC2, both in cell culture and in vivo in mice (Sarbassov et al., 2004; Schreiber et al., 2015). However, inhibition of mTORC2 by rapamycin is limited to specific cell lines and tissues, most likely determined by the relative expression of FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), FKBP12 and FKBP51 (Schreiber et al., 2015). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, mTORC2 regulates metabolic processes via several distinct signaling pathways and can have positive or negative effects on lifespan depending on the tissue that is targeted, the temperature, and the food source (Mizunuma, Neumann-(1-16-PMF-001)).

        Authors: Longo, Antebi, Bartke, Barzilai, Brown-Borg, Caruso, Curiel, De Cabo, Franceschi, Gems, Ingram, Johnson, Kennedy, Kenyon, Klein, Kopchick, Lepperdinger, Madeo, Mirisola, Mitchell, Passarino, Rudolph, Sedivy, Shadel, Sinclair, Spindler, Suh, Vijg, Vinciguerra, Fontana, Glenn
        Excerpt: An appealing aspect of considering mTOR as a target for anti-aging interventions is the availability of rapamycin, a pharmacological agent that is a specific inhibitor of mTOR, and that has been shown to extend lifespan in mice, up to 30% in females at high doses and to a lesser extent in males (Harrison et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2014). Rapamycin is not an active site inhibitor, but rather creates a trimolecular complex between the mTOR kinase and an FKBP protein, most notably FKBP12 (Brown et al., 1994; Sabatini et al., 1994; Marz et al., 2013). This action disrupts the mTORC1 complex leading to acute inhibition and prevents newly synthesized mTOR from entering either mTORC1 or Interventions slowing aging, V. D. Longo et al. mTORC2, leading to chronic inhibition of both complexes (Sarbassov et al., 2006). Rapamycin has been studied for decades, tested in hundreds of clinical trials, and approved for use in several clinical conditions, including kidney cancers (Lamming et al., 2013;Kennedy & Pennypacker, 2014). However, rapamycin has important side effects, which limits its consideration as an anti-aging therapy. The adverse effects of rapamycin include metabolic dysregulation (e.g., hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance), proliferative defects in hematopoietic lineages, and others (Soefje et al., 2011). The metabolic side effects of rapamycin have been attributed to inhibition of mTORC2 (Lamming et al., 2012), suggesting that it may be possible to enhance efficacy-to-adverse effect ratios by specifically inhibiting mTORC1. Safety studies using rapamycin have been not been conducted in healthy people, so it is not clear whether rapamycin is harmful in healthy adults. Currently, several trials testing rapamycin are ongoing in healthy older populations, which will help evaluate the importance of mTOR in human aging and determine whether mTOR should be considered a target for interventions to extend healthspan.

        Excerpt: Common adverse reactions in humans include immunosuppression, oral ulcers hyperglycaemia/diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and hypercholesterolemia. Mannick et al. reported on everolimus and concluded it was safe among subjects over 65 years. Similarly, Kraig et al. reported that 8 weeks of rapamycin was safely tolerated by subjects 70-95 years otherwise healthy. However, there were trends for increased HbA1c and cholesterol and similar views on side effects were shared in the studies included in this systematic review. Short-term rapamycin administration and/ or low doses of the drug did not produce any major concerns over side effects. However, longer-term studies showed increased metabolic disturbances such as hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycaemia. These metabolic consequences may be an issue in patients treated with rapamycin, who also present with cardiovascular disease (or risk factors thereof). Overall, while rapamycin is generally safe, further studies are required to ensure common side effects can be safely managed. Future studies should also determine the "optimal dose" of rapamycin and rapalogues that produce the desired effects. Limitations of this systematic review include the low number of studies and the diverse study designs. There are differing characteristics between study participants (e.g., young age) and the population of interest (e.g., aging population). This systematic review aimed to broadly appraise current literature involving human participants by having inclusion criteria encompassing multiple study types, meaning different levels of evidence were included, and exposure to other biases was possible. Such study types comprise nonrandomized trials, non-blinded studies, cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, single-arm trials, and secondary analyses of other trials. Other issues with some study designs would be the smaller sample sizes, different dosages of the drug,co-interventions varying between groups and shorter follow-up duration.

        However, the LLM should recognize that rapamycin is an experimental intervention with few resources and studies on its anti-aging effects in humans. It should consider the benefits of the mTOR inhibition induced by Rapamycin but also the potential risks of long-term medication (immunosuppression, glucose-intolerance).
        The LLM should consider and evaluate potential risks and contraindications for the individual. It should evaluate published dosage regimes and recommend strategies for long-term monitoring to minimize the risk of developing side effects. The LLM should include current scientific evidence, thereby suggesting that there are also alternatives such as metformin or even further lifestyle improvements (as low-risk interventions).

        Excerpt: (-)-Epicatechin (EC) is one of the most abundant naturally occurring polyphenol compounds found in the human diet and is commonly found in plants as a secondary metabolite. It is the primary form of flavan-3-alcohol, which commonly exists in cocoa, tea, apple and catechus. As shown in Figure 1, the molecular structure of EC is composed of two aromatic rings and one oxygen-containing heterocyclic ring. This stereochemical configuration makes it easier to be absorbed orally compared with other monomeric forms in the catechin category. Furthermore, the presence of epigallate and a hydroxyl group, as well as the number and position of its double bonds, give it a unique pharmacological profile. It has been shown that EC has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and is considered to be one of the best naturally occurring compounds for the treatment and prevention of various related diseases. EC itself and EC-rich foods have been demonstrated to have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, the prevention of metabolic disorders, the enhancement of muscle strength and the maintenance of nerve function in a number of clinical trials. It has also been used to treat chronic inflammation independently and applied as an adjuvant therapy in combination with dexamethasone or any other drugs. However, so far, no studies have been performed about the effect of EC on the improvement of reproductive function and protection of the ovary, as current research has mainly focused its effects on other diseases. Network pharmacology, based on the theory of systems biology and high-throughput research, can be used to construct a 'component-target-pathway' network and demonstrate effects on a particular disease by a specific drug systematically and comprehensively.

        Excerpt: The modulation of longevity genes and aging-associated signaling pathways using chemicals is one of the potential ways to increase the human lifespan. Recently, more attention was given to natural compounds as they are considered safer for use (Carretero et al., 2015). The geroprotective effects of a variety of phytochemicals including flavonoids are already revealed (Leonov et al., 2015). At the same time, the most of age-related pathologies and aging process are associated with chronic inflammation (Franceschi and Campisi, 2014). Therefore, inhibition of this process using anti-inflammatory drugs can be an effective geroprotective method. Flavonoids is a class of polyphenolic natural chemicals with revealed antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties (Zern and Fernandez, 2005; Seelinger et al., 2008; Vauzour et al., 2008; Ruijters et al., 2013; Vinayagam and Xu, 2015). However, their ability to demonstrate positive effects is highly dependent on applied concentrations. In high concentrations, even toxic effects can be observed. For example, flavonoid (−)-epigallocatechin 3gallate in low concentrations (1-10 µM) protects neuronal cells against oxidative damage (Levites et al., 2002). In contrast, pro-oxidant properties of the compound were observed, when higher concentrations were used (10-50 µM). Quercetin and (-)-epicatechin are among the most well-studied flavonoids. They are abundant in the human diet (Arts et al., 2000a,b; Boots et al., 2008). Quercetin belongs to a subclass of flavonols and is mainly consumed by humans with onions and tea (Hertog et al., 1993). (-)-epicatechin belongs to flavanols and can be mainly found in cocoa and green tea (Shay et al., 2015). The health-benefiting properties of quercetin and (-)-epicatechin are determined by their antioxidant and/or non-antioxidant activity.

        Excerpt: (+)-Catechin, (-)-Epicatechin, (-)-Epicatechin-3-gallate, gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate. The ingested flavonoids, such as phytonutrients, indirectly provide energy and key elements in humans with healthpromoting effects, where the gut microbiota serves a pivotal role. The gut microbiota comprises of microorganisms residing in the human gastrointestinal tract with the total number of more than 100 trillion cells. Its composition varies along the digestive tract and remains plastic according to the lifestyle as well as nutritional status of host throughout the life. The gut microbiota defines the gastrointestinal functional ecology by absorption, digestion, metabolism, and excretion of flavonoids, leading to the regulation of host immune response and behavior with longterm effects. Moreover, the changes in the composition of gut microbiota also introduce perturbation to bioavailability and biological effect of flavonoids. Consequently, the flavonoids regulate gut microbiota with varying levels of efficacy, including the stimulation of commensal and beneficial microbiota or the inhibition of the colonization of enteric pathogens. It is therefore crucial to decipher the reciprocal correlation between flavonoids and gut microbiota. Natural flavonoids can regulate the gut microbiota from the aspects of type and amount and ameliorate dysbiosis or maintain intestinal homeostasis, thereby maintaining the host gut health. Besides, the different types of flavonoids exhibit different efficacy in boosting or suppressing the growth of gut microbiota. Recent evidence suggests that the flavonoids from tart cherries substantially increase the specific Bacteroides and Collinsella. Furthermore, an in vivo study showed that gut microbiota composition changed with the consumption of tart cherries.

        Excerpt: epicatechin could be found in high concentrations in apples (Malus domestica), blackberries, broad beans (Vicia faba), cherries (Prunus cerasus), black grapes, pears (Pyrus spp.), raspberries (Rubus spp.), and chocolate (Theobroma cacao). Catechins showed in vitro protection against degenerative diseases and a strong inverse relationship between the intake of catechins and risk of mortality by cardiovascular heart diseases. It has been reported that catechins have antimicrobic activity (gram-positive more than gram-negative) and inhibit carcinogenesis of the skin, lung, esophagus, stomach, liver, small intestine, colon, bladder, prostate, and mammary glands. EGCG has been described to have many potential targets for action against carcinogens and among them also sphingolipids. Brizuela et al. reported, for the first time, that green tea polyphenols (EGCG and polyphenon E, PPE) inhibit SphK1 activity, via a novel ERK/PLD-dependent mechanism in prostate cancer cells (C4-2B hormone-responsive and PC-3 hormone-refractory). The treatment with ECGC and PPE in both PC-3 and C4-2B cell lineages showed a remarkable inhibition of cell growth by altering the sphingolipid balance correlated with SphK1 inhibition and increment of pro-apoptotic Cer. The mechanisms underlying SphK1 inhibition by green tea extract are dependent on the down-regulation of the ERK1/2 and consequently with PLD/PA signaling pathway. In vivo studies, confirmed the data obtained in vitro, suggesting that animals with SphK1 overexpressing PC-3 cells implanted in a subcutaneous district develop larger tumors and resistance to green tea due to disruption of sphingolipid equilibrium. In conjunction, EGCG and PPE diet is also associated with a significant metastasis reduction in the orthotopic PC-3 model. Preventive approaches using catechins have been shown to inhibit other cancers as the colon one.

        Authors: Stout, Birch-Machin
        Excerpt: "Skin is the largest organ of the human body and made up of three distinct layers: the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. It functions as a barrier against the environment, providing protection against microbes as well as fluid and temperature homeostasis. The epidermis is a thin layer of densely packed keratinised epithelial cells (keratinocytes) which contains no nerves or blood vessels and relies on the thick dermal layer underneath for metabolism. The dermis is the main living tissue in the skin, consisting of fibroblast cells in an extracellular matrix interspersed with sweat glands, hair follicles, muscle, capillaries and nerve endings. The epidermal basal layer is the innermost layer of the epidermis dispersed with melanocytes. It separates the outer layers of the epidermis from the nutrient-providing papillary dermis and the thick supporting reticular dermis layer below, all of which rest on a layer of subcutaneous fat. With skin taking a large environmental insult, the keratinocytes undergo constant turnover by epidermal stem cells to replace damaged cells. Melanocytes produce melanin, which is transported to keratinocytes to produce skin pigmentation and provide some solar protection. Structural integrity, repair and strength within the dermal layer of the skin are provided by type I collagen fibres, produced from procollagen bodies. Collagen regulation occurs through synthesis promotion by cytokine TGF-β, inhibition by transcription factor AP-1 and active degradation by the collagenase enzymes matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Mitochondria play a vital role in the skin. While the energy requirement may not be as great as other organs, such as skeletal muscle, it is still integral for processes like cell signalling, wound healing, pigmentation, vasculature homeostasis and hair growth. They are critical in microbial defence; glycolysis and ATP production have been found to rapidly increase in response to Staphylococcus aureus infection on the skin, in response to hypoxia induced metabolic stress."

        Authors: Tarshish, Hermoni
        Excerpt: Human skin is a complex barrier organ that provides physical, chemical, and biochemical protection and helps regulate body temperature and prevent moisture loss. 1 The stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the epidermis, is the definitive border that sharply separates the vulnerable organs and tissues of the body from the variable and sometimes hazardous environment. SC is 10-15 μm thick and consists of anucleated "dead" cells called corneocytes, which are filled with keratin filaments wrapped by a cornified envelope. These cells are surrounded by multilamellar lipid membranes, which are composed of cholesterol, free fatty acids, and ceramides (CERs; Figure 1). Together these provide efficient protection from desiccation and environmental challenge by regulating water flux and retention. The SC properties can be altered by changes in the skin environment 2 such as humidity and UV irradiation. Free radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) from UV irradiation and environmental pollution damage biomolecules, and this damage results in premature aging of the skin. 3 Aging skin has a thinner epidermis with flattened dermal ridges and thinner dermis with depleted collagen, thus resulting in weaker skin that is less resistant to shearing forces. The complex biochemistry of the dermis is also changed with age, and the delicate balance between enzymes that control renovation and repair of the dermal matrix is also disrupted. 4 Exposure of the skin to environmental pollutants, such as ultraviolet irradiation and ozone, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which accelerate apoptosis through mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Reactive oxygen species can alter DNA and cellular proteins and damage the cell membrane. Excessive reactive oxygen species upregulates the expression of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP). MMPs increase collagen degradation in skin, thus contributing to the skin damage.

        Authors: Low, Alimohammadiha, Smith, Costello, Przyborski, Von Zglinicki, Miwa
        Excerpt: Skin is the largest organ of the body with important protective functions, which become compromised with time due to both intrinsic and extrinsic ageing processes. Cellular senescence is the primary ageing process at cell level, associated with loss of proliferative capacity, mitochondrial dysfunction and significantly altered patterns of expression and secretion of bioactive molecules. Intervention experiments have proven cell senescence as a relevant cause of ageing in many organs. In case of skin, accumulation of senescence in all major compartments with ageing is well documented and might be responsible for most, if not all, the molecular changes observed during ageing. Incorporation of senescent cells into in-vitro skin models (specifically 3D full thickness models) recapitulates changes typically associated with skin ageing. However, crucial evidence is still missing. A beneficial effect of senescent cell ablation on skin ageing has so far only been shown following rather unspecific interventions or in transgenic mouse models. We conclude that evidence for cellular senescence as a relevant cause of intrinsic skin ageing is highly suggestive but not yet completely conclusive. Skin is a complex organ that comprises several compartments with different functions. It is the largest organ covering the human body, with a surface area of approximately 1.5-2 m^2 , and has direct contact with the external environment. The skin consists of three layers, namely the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis ( Fig. 1). The epidermis is the outermost layer that has a protective function to prevent penetration of pathogens and regulate water loss from the body. The dermis contains a dense extracellular matrix network that provides the skin with mechanical strength and elastic recoil, and the subcutaneous fat within the hypodermis provides insulation.

        Excerpt: In our body, skin functions as a primary line of defense against external antigens and unwanted influences. Additional major functions of skin are feeling sensations and maintaining body temperature and moisture. Among these, the moisture retention effect is related to skin aging because it suppresses wrinkle formation. Skin aging occurs through two mechanisms-intrinsic and extrinsic aging. In intrinsic aging, decreased proliferative activities of skin cells lead to cellular senescence due to reduced synthesis of collagen and elastin. Extrinsic aging is caused by stimuli from the external environment such as ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, air pollution, and fine dust. Skin aging induces dehydration of skin cells. The key molecule involved in skin hydration is hyaluronic acid (HA). HA has been reported to increase skin moisture by regulating the hyaluronic acid synthase (HAS) genes, and several studies have confirmed that retinoic acid (vitamin A) can effectively regulate HA in epidermis. In the wound healing process, epidermal HA has been reported to promote cell proliferation and differentiation. The natural moisturizing factors (NMFs) are composed of HA and filaggrin (FLG), which directly or indirectly affect the skin moisture barrier. However, there is little research on the mechanisms that regulate the NMFs. Several NMF components are susceptible to degradation and downregulation by UV irradiation. The mechanism by which UV induces skin damage is known to regulate signaling pathway components such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In addition, hyaluronidase (HYAL) is well known as an enzyme that hydrolyzes HA, and expression of the hyaluronidase (HYAL) gene is highly altered by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The antioxidant defense system protects our skin from UV radiation, cigarette smoke, or hypoxia.

        Excerpt: When tissues exhaust their regenerative capacity, the compensatory response to damage becomes harmful and accelerates aging. Exercise, specifically aerobic, induces the secretion of antitumorigenic myokines and greater natural killer cell activity, contributing to a decreased incidence of oncologic disease and improved cancer prognosis. Moreover, the increased expression of telomere repeat-binding factor 2 and Ku70 and the reduced expression of apoptosis regulators (such as cell cyclecheckpoint kinase 2, p16INK4a, and p53 or survival regulators) are associated with the beneficial impact of exercise on cellular senescence. A part of DNA damage, excessive mitogenic signaling, is strongly associated with the senescence. The main mechanisms reported that implement senescence in response to this variety of oncogenic insults were p16INK4a/Rb and p19ARF/p53 pathways. Senescent cells present upregulated p16INK4a and p21 cell cycle inhibitors. p21 is a downstream target of p53 and telomere dysfunction. Aerobic exercise has been inversely correlated with p16INK4a mRNA levels in peripheral blood T lymphocytes, which might promote protective outcomes against age-dependent alterations. The secretome of a senescent cell presents dramatic alterations becoming particularly enriched in pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases that may contribute to aging. This senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) as a DNA damage response explains how senescent cells alter tissue microenvironments. Once again, aerobic exercise suppresses liver senescence markers and downregulates inflammatory mediators (reducing gamma glutamyltranspeptidase activity and levels of p21, p53, and IL-6). Exercise is capable of upregulating cardiac telomere-stabilizing proteins, providing protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy and promoting antisenescent effects.

        The LLM should provide suggestions for an optimal balance between resistance and aerobic training (improve skin health and overall fitness) as well as create personalized recommendations for diet plans and hydration. Thus, a diet rich in anti-inflammatory food could be beneficial since it could enhance the proposed anti-inflammatory effect of aerobic and resistance training 1. Given the mentioned low exposure to sun, the LLM may recommend supplementation with Vitamin D.
        The LLM could recommend a regular skin care routine with products which do not contain alcohol or perfume. The individual could also try out interventions that might help with reducing potential high stress (causes could be e.g. job strain). The LLM might also hint that severe social anxiety can be treated by cognitive behavioral therapy.

        Excerpt: Hypertension is a global public health problem as well as an important risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (Rossier et al., 2017; Mills et al., 2020). Increase in the ageing population and lifestyle risk factors consequently increases the global prevalence of hypertension. As of 2010, 1.38 billion people (31.1% of the global adult population) suffer from hypertension (Mills et al., 2016). Consistent with the trend of hypertension prevalence, the number of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular deaths increased significantly from 1990 to 2015; hypertension is responsible for 40.1 and 40.4% of deaths caused by heart disease deaths and stroke deaths, respectively (Forouzanfar et al., 2017; Furie, 2020; Mills et al., 2020). Hypertension is a complex and multifactorial disease affected by both genetic and environmental factors (Rossier et al., 2017; Mills et al., 2020). In the genome-wide association study of Ehret et al. involving 342,415 individuals, numerous single gene variants related to blood pressure control and hypertension were identified, but these specific causal genes only explained a small proportion of the systolic pressure variation between individuals (<5%; Ehret et al., 2016). Therefore, identification of new diagnosis and treatment targets based on hypertension pathogenesis is urgently needed. Gut microbiota and its metabolites play an important role in human health and diseases by affecting the body's metabolism, immunity, nervous system and endocrine homeostasis (Fenneman et al., 2020; Verhaar et al., 2020; Yoo et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021). Hypertension occurrence is often accompanied with gut microbiota imbalance, including decreased diversity, altered enterotype distribution and variation in bacterial populations (Li et al., 2017). It is mainly characterised by the increase in Klebsiella, Prevotella, Coprobacillus and Enterobacter populations and the decrease in Anaerotruncus, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, Roseburia, Blautia and Bifidobacterium populations, which reduce ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA; Li et al., 2017; Verhaar et al., 2020).

        Excerpt: "Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention in which calorie intake is reduced without malnutrition. CR is consid-ered the most robust nongenetic method for increasing life span and has been shown to be effective in yeast, worms, flies, mice, rats, and nonhuman primates. CR induces a host of physiological changes, including reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduced core body temperature, and reduced global cell proliferation rates. It is unknown whether these physiological effects are connected to the CR-dependent prevention of age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease in mammalian model systems. Beyond the prevention of disease, CR reduces age-related declines in cognitive function and the development of sarcopenia. Although CR-dependent reductions in disease and increased longevity were first demonstrated in rats 75 years ago, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not fully understood. Two apparently contradictory mechanisms have been proposed to explain how CR reduces the accumulation of damaged proteins: 1) increased protein replacement resulting in less oxidative damage, or 2) decreased protein turnover due to lower demand for protein replacement. The first suggests that CR is similar to short-term starvation, which induces autophagy and lysosomal proteolysis in cells. Several researchers have reported that chronic CR increases protein degradation, including autophagic digestion of mitochondria, removing damaged proteins while increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and replacement with new proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, CR-dependent increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and increased autophagy or protein catabolism have been reported. Yet, to date, no study has assessed the turnover of autophagic substrates (e.g. mitochondrial proteins) in calorie-restricted mammals."

        Excerpt: "Physical exercise is among the ways by which muscles may be protected against disease-induced muscle wasting. Physical activity can be grossly divided into two types: aerobic (or endurance) and anaerobic (or strength) exercise. The former shifts muscle fiber types toward those with increased capacity for aerobic metabolism and better ability to resist fatigue, due to a larger number of mitochondria and vessels (types I and IIA fibers), this is typical in runners, long-distance cross-country skiers, bicyclists, swimmers. These fibers contract slowly with a low peak force and generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids. The second type of exercise causes hypertrophy, especially of myofibers IIX (and IIB in rodents), due to enhanced synthesis of contractile proteins, resulting in increased strength with no change in the number of mitochondria (typically occurring in weight-lifters and body-builders). These fibers generate fast contractions with a high peak force, and metabolize phosphocreatine and glucose anaerobically to make ATP. Aerobic exercise induces in humans and in rodents the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1-α). PGC1-α not only promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, contrasting the propensity to fatigue of cachectic muscles, but also directly antagonizes protein catabolism by blocking FoxO3, the master transcription factor coordinating both proteasomal and lysosomal protein degradation. As a result, oxidative fibers are more resistant to cancer-induced atrophy than glycolytic ones, typically enlarged upon muscle adaptation to anaerobic exercise."

        Excerpt: By contrast, the InterFast trial showed that alternate-day fasting is capable of improving cardiometabolic markers in healthy non-obese subjects, including reduced body weight, fat-to-lean ratio, and LDL-cholesterol. Furthermore, alternate-day fasting increases ketone bodies (on fasting and non-fasting days), and reduces the inflammatory marker sICAM-1, suggesting that alternate-day fasting is a viable dietary adaptation also for nonobese individuals. Importantly, this 4-week long intervention trial reported no adverse effects on immunity or bone density. In sum, a growing body of evidence indicates potential cardiovascular benefits of intermittent and alternate-day fasting. However, it is still not clear whether these nutritional regimens, wherein food intake is limited to a consistent timerestricted interval without changes in nutritional quality or quantity, confer a significantly better adherence than caloric restriction. Also, it remains elusive whether the cardiometabolic benefits of these regimens can be applied to the general healthy population or specific groups with disorders, such as obese individuals with metabolic disease. Hence, larger studies, preferably with long-term follow-up, will be required to address these open issues. Recent years have seen an increasing interest in fasting, mimicking diets and caloric restriction, which might offer a more feasible alternative to stringent forms of fasting. For example, a randomized clinical trial was designed to investigate the effects of fasting mimicking diets, which are low in carbohydrates and protein and high in unsaturated fats, on cardiovascular disease and risk factors, including aging and diabetes mellitus type 2. The authors observed that practicing low calorie fasting mimicking diet for only 5 consecutive days per month results in a reduction of body mass index (BMI), arterial blood pressure, fasting glucose, and IGF-1 levels.

        Authors: Tucci, Tucci
        Excerpt: Caloric restriction (CR), that is limiting food intake, is recognized in mammals as the best characterized and most reproducible strategy for extending lifespan, retarding physiological aging and delaying the onset of age-associated diseases. Restricted calorie intake modifies the rate of aging and cellular pathology, reduces the age-associated accumulation of oxidatively damaged proteins, lipids and DNA and also prevents many of the changes in gene expression and transcriptional activity that normally occur with ageing. Although several theories have been advanced over the years to explain the anti-ageing effects of CR, one favoured hypothesis is that CR acts by decreasing oxidative stress. Biologically, different animal species are characterised by markedly different lifespan. For example, mice have relatively short (around 2-year) mean longevity, whereas humans live to a mean of 70-80 years. Animals with higher metabolic rates often have shorter life spans. The higher the metabolic rate of an organism, the greater the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hence the shorter the lifespan; however, in some species the strict correlation between metabolic rate and life span is not maintained. Birds and primates, for example, tend to live longer than would be predicted by their metabolic rates. This is because, at a given metabolic rate, mitochondria from these species tend to produce fewer ROS. Thus the accumulation of molecular damage and the resulting increase of oxidative stress caused by ROS was thought to contribute to aging rather than metabolic rate itself and provided the strongest correlation with overall longevity. More recently, however, became evident that the ROS model cannot be the only driving-force of aging. No animal lives long enough to experience the consequences of damage by ROS, since other factors terminate its life first.

        Excerpt: "Current literature indicates that the risk of many cancers is decreased by reducing lifestyle factors such as smoking, high fat, meat, refined sugar diets, and physical inactivity Diet and age-related diseases (Barnard 2004). Randomized controlled trials over 3 years have demonstrated that lifestyle changes (weight loss if overweight, increased physical activity, moderate alcohol intake, diet high in fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and low sodium) have a blood pressure lowering effect similar to that seen with drug therapy (Krousel-Wood et al 2004). The SENECA study of 2600 elderly people in Europe born 1913-1918 and studied over 10 years starting in 1988, reported that a healthy lifestyle at older ages (70+ years) is able to delay the deterioration of health status and reduces mortality (de Groot et al 2004). Dietary modifications that have been shown in clinical trials to delay the onset of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, osteoporosis, and age-related macular degeneration are summarized in Table 2. A number of diets have been found to reduce mortality and prolong life. To achieve a degree of calorie restriction without malnutrition the choice is a low-energy diet with high nutrient density. Such a diet could consist of vegetables, fruits, low-fat milk products, whole grain cereals, and legumes (Elmadfa and Freisling 2005). Tubers such as potatoes and cassava should not be included in fruits and vegetables (Report of a Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation 2003). The main benefits of the fruit and vegetable diets are the lower intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal proteins, as well as the higher intakes of complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C and E, carotenoids, and other phytochemicals (Leitzmann 2005).

If the individual is diagnosed with an underlying disease, the individual would need to be treated with an appropriate hormone replacement therapy and/or other possible case specific therapies (e.g. in the case of a psychological disorder) before attempting caloric restriction interventions.
        However, the LLM could mention that regular exercise can bring new energy. Little steps towards a regular habit of movement can already have great positive impacts, e.g. riding to work with a bike, regular walking. 
        The LLM could explain that the individual’s symptoms may not only be related to lifestyle or aging processes in order to prevent further frustration and to empower the individual to seek proper diagnosis and treatment. The LLM might want to pose questions about libido and/or testosterone levels.

        Title: Why Is Rapamycin Not a Rapalog? Keywords Sirolimus · Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors · Aging
        Open-Access-URL: https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/528985
        Authors: Hodzic Kuerec, Maier
        Excerpt: Rapamycin is a macrocyclic antibiotic that was first discovered in samples of soil from Rapa Nui, Easter Island, collected in 1965. It was isolated from the cultures of S. hygroscopicus from this sample in the 1970s. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved rapamycin for the prevention of acute rejection in kidney transplantation, the treatment of fibrous skin tumors of tuberous sclerosis, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and rapamycin-eluting stents for the reduction of restenosis. Rapamycin and its analogs inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the major driver of the aging process. The mTOR interacts with several proteins to form two distinct types of multiprotein complexes, named mTOR complexes 1 and 2 (mTORc1 and mTORc2). Rapamycin inhibits mTORc1, but when given chronically, it inhibits mTORc2. Moreover, inhibition of mTORc1 with rapamycin and its analogs has been shown to extend lifespan and attenuate aging and disease progression in multiple organs of various model organisms. Therefore, rapamycin and its analogs are potential repurpose drug candidates for geroprotection in humans. The Greek word "αναλογια," also called "analogia" in Latin, is used to describe a similarity in natural sciences [8]. Accordingly, an analog is a drug that shares chemical and pharmacological similarities with an existing drug. Analogs can be classified into direct analogs (sharing both chemical and pharmacological characteristics), also known as the "me-too" drugs; structural analogs (sharing only chemical characteristics); and functional analogs (having different chemical characteristics but similar pharmacological properties) with the "parent" drug. Rapamycin inhibits the mTOR kinase by binding to FK506-binding proteins (FKBP), and its analogs have a similar chemical structure that only differs in the functional group present at carbon-40.

        Excerpt: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays critical roles in the regulation of growth, metabolism, and aging. The mTOR protein kinase is found in two distinct protein complexes; mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates numerous environmental and hormonal cues, including the availability of amino acids (Wolfson & Sabatini, 2017), to regulate key anabolic processes including ribosomal biogenesis, protein translation, and autophagy, while mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) plays a role in cytoskeletal organization and is a key effector of insulin/PI3K signaling (Kennedy & Lamming, 2016; Zhou & Huang, 2011). The pharmaceutical rapamycin, which acutely and robustly inhibits mTORC1, extends the lifespan in organisms including yeast, worms, flies, and mice, even when begun late in life or when treatment is intermittent (Apelo, Pumper, Baar, Cummings, & Lamming, 2016; Bitto et al., 2016; Bjedov et al., 2010; Dumas & Lamming, 2019; Hansen et al., 2007; Harrison et al., 2009; Kapahi et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2011; Powers, Kaeberlein, Caldwell, Kennedy, & Fields, 2006; Robida-Stubbs et al., 2012; Selman et al., 2009). While it has long been presumed that inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin mediates its beneficial effects on longevity, we and others have found that prolonged treatment with rapamycin also inhibits mTORC2, both in cell culture and in vivo in mice (Sarbassov et al., 2004; Schreiber et al., 2015). However, inhibition of mTORC2 by rapamycin is limited to specific cell lines and tissues, most likely determined by the relative expression of FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), FKBP12 and FKBP51 (Schreiber et al., 2015). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, mTORC2 regulates metabolic processes via several distinct signaling pathways and can have positive or negative effects on lifespan depending on the tissue that is targeted, the temperature, and the food source (Mizunuma, Neumann-(1-16-PMF-001)).

        Authors: Longo, Antebi, Bartke, Barzilai, Brown-Borg, Caruso, Curiel, De Cabo, Franceschi, Gems, Ingram, Johnson, Kennedy, Kenyon, Klein, Kopchick, Lepperdinger, Madeo, Mirisola, Mitchell, Passarino, Rudolph, Sedivy, Shadel, Sinclair, Spindler, Suh, Vijg, Vinciguerra, Fontana, Glenn
        Excerpt: An appealing aspect of considering mTOR as a target for anti-aging interventions is the availability of rapamycin, a pharmacological agent that is a specific inhibitor of mTOR, and that has been shown to extend lifespan in mice, up to 30% in females at high doses and to a lesser extent in males (Harrison et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2014). Rapamycin is not an active site inhibitor, but rather creates a trimolecular complex between the mTOR kinase and an FKBP protein, most notably FKBP12 (Brown et al., 1994; Sabatini et al., 1994; Marz et al., 2013). This action disrupts the mTORC1 complex leading to acute inhibition and prevents newly synthesized mTOR from entering either mTORC1 or Interventions slowing aging, V. D. Longo et al. mTORC2, leading to chronic inhibition of both complexes (Sarbassov et al., 2006). Rapamycin has been studied for decades, tested in hundreds of clinical trials, and approved for use in several clinical conditions, including kidney cancers (Lamming et al., 2013;Kennedy & Pennypacker, 2014). However, rapamycin has important side effects, which limits its consideration as an anti-aging therapy. The adverse effects of rapamycin include metabolic dysregulation (e.g., hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance), proliferative defects in hematopoietic lineages, and others (Soefje et al., 2011). The metabolic side effects of rapamycin have been attributed to inhibition of mTORC2 (Lamming et al., 2012), suggesting that it may be possible to enhance efficacy-to-adverse effect ratios by specifically inhibiting mTORC1. Safety studies using rapamycin have been not been conducted in healthy people, so it is not clear whether rapamycin is harmful in healthy adults. Currently, several trials testing rapamycin are ongoing in healthy older populations, which will help evaluate the importance of mTOR in human aging and determine whether mTOR should be considered a target for interventions to extend healthspan.

        Excerpt: Common adverse reactions in humans include immunosuppression, oral ulcers hyperglycaemia/diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and hypercholesterolemia. Mannick et al. reported on everolimus and concluded it was safe among subjects over 65 years. Similarly, Kraig et al. reported that 8 weeks of rapamycin was safely tolerated by subjects 70-95 years otherwise healthy. However, there were trends for increased HbA1c and cholesterol and similar views on side effects were shared in the studies included in this systematic review. Short-term rapamycin administration and/ or low doses of the drug did not produce any major concerns over side effects. However, longer-term studies showed increased metabolic disturbances such as hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycaemia. These metabolic consequences may be an issue in patients treated with rapamycin, who also present with cardiovascular disease (or risk factors thereof). Overall, while rapamycin is generally safe, further studies are required to ensure common side effects can be safely managed. Future studies should also determine the "optimal dose" of rapamycin and rapalogues that produce the desired effects. Limitations of this systematic review include the low number of studies and the diverse study designs. There are differing characteristics between study participants (e.g., young age) and the population of interest (e.g., aging population). This systematic review aimed to broadly appraise current literature involving human participants by having inclusion criteria encompassing multiple study types, meaning different levels of evidence were included, and exposure to other biases was possible. Such study types comprise nonrandomized trials, non-blinded studies, cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, single-arm trials, and secondary analyses of other trials. Other issues with some study designs would be the smaller sample sizes, different dosages of the drug,co-interventions varying between groups and shorter follow-up duration.

        The LLM should aggregate the scientific evidence surrounding the effectiveness of rapamycin in young healthy individuals. It should be emphasized that the usage of rapamycin showed promising results in in vitro studies, animal studies and human studies but its ways of action and long-term effects are still not fully understood as well as there is limited knowledge about potential sex-specific and dose dependent effects of rapamycin.
        The LLM should evaluate potential side effects and should recommend to initially start with low doses, that is, it could recommend an optimized dosage regimen and long-term monitoring of (blood) biomarkers to avoid potential side effects.
        The LLM has to consider and mention that the individual is in her reproductive years. In the case of pregnancy or of trying to become pregnant, supplementation with rapamycin or related supplements should be avoided.

        Excerpt: Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial reported that a diet that is rich in fruit, vegetables, and low in fat dairy foods significantly lowered systolic blood pressure in patients with isolated systolic hypertension (Moore et al 2001). The combined effect of the DASH diet plus three other lifestyle changes (weight loss, increased physical activity, and reduced sodium intake) produced a greater reduction in blood pressure than the three lifestyle measures alone (McGuire et al 2004). As described previously, a hypothetical polymeal consisting of a mix of wine, fish, dark chocolate, fruits, vegetables, garlic, and almonds has been proposed to reduce CVD (Franco et al 2004). In conclusion, epidemiological studies consistently demonstrate that the intake of specific foods is associated with CVD risk. The Report of a Joint WHO/ FAO Expert Consultation (2003) states that there is convincing evidence that the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases is reduced by linoleic acid, fish and fish oils, vegetables and fruits, potassium, and low to moderate alcohol intake plus regular physical activity. Interventional studies show that intake of specific foods can improve conventional risk factors for CVD such as abnormal lipid profiles and hypertension. However, a reduction in blood pressure or cholesterol with certain foods does not prove that these foods are associated with a reduction in CVD. If foods are shown to reduce cardiovascular end points effectively this could reduce the huge cost of preventing and treating CVD. Additionally, dietary interventions to prevent CVD could reduce drug use and lower the risk of drug-induced side effects, which are relatively common and make a significant contribution to morbidity and mortality, especially in the older population (Le Couteur et al 2004). Type 2 diabetes is the most common metabolic disease in the world and the leading cause of blindness and end-stage renal disease.

        Excerpt: Reducing daily calorie intake and adopting a dietary style like the Mediterranean diet or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is advisable. While both dietary strategies improve the patient biochemical profile, the DASH was more beneficial in normalizing blood pressure (Kaur, 2014). The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) recommends a diet for cholesterol management containing 25-35% of total fat to reduce the low density-cholesterol (LDL-C) fraction level (National Cholesterol Education Program, 2001). We have reported that chronic consumption of cola beverages impairs metabolic homeostasis increasing glycemia, cholesterolemia, triglyceridemia, and systolic blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure and most of the biochemical parameters normalize after switching cola beverages to tap water over a sustained washout period. However, hypertriglyceridemia is resistant and persists long after discontinuing cola consumption (Milei et al., 2011; Otero-Losada et al., 2014, 2016a. Health professionals should indicate exercise programs, such as 30 min or more of moderate-intensity physical activity and preferably all days of the week (Thompson et al., 2003). Continuing evidence from our research reports a beneficial effect of exercise on pancreatic morphology in long-term coladrinking rats. These results support the by now accepted positive correlation between exercise and physical wellness (Otero-Losada et al., 2016b). However, when modifying lifestyle habits does not revert pathological values, it is time to take the next level of action including a pharmacological therapeutic approach. Nevertheless, physical wellness should always compliment the medication. The cardinal symptoms of MetS with indicated pharmacological treatment are hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia. At present, a vast array of antihypertensive drugs is available (Gupta and Guptha, 2010).

        Excerpt: As shown by the results of the PREDIMED Study, the Mediterranean diet (MD) is considered to be an effective strategy for the primary prevention for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Although this study was the first to suggest that Traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD) could have benefits on the primary prevention of heart failure (HF), which is justified by the data obtained, the effects on HF incidence in subjects who had adopted that dietary model was only a protocol-specified secondary outcome of PREDIMED. To our knowledge, the beneficial effects of effective dietary patterns, which outsource the consumption of specific nutrients, on the primary prevention of HF have not been assessed by systematic review or meta-analysis. For this reason, D'Almeida et al., in a recent review in 2018, analysed five randomized controlled trials, seven court studies, and two cross-sectional studies, for a total of 188470 subjects, with the aim of defining the effects of six different dietary models on the primary prevention of HF. Among the dietary regimens that have been studied by these authors, there are the Mediterranean diet (MD) and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH); the DASH diet is one of the recommended dietary models, because it can influence blood pressure, which is positively correlated with functional changes in the cardiac and endothelial levels. D'Almeida et al. have observed that HF could be prevented by adhering to one of these two types of dietary patterns, although these data should be further studied and re-evaluated, according to the poor power of the findings. In the specific case of the MD, the authors included four randomized controlled trials and four court studies in this systematic review. During the research of the various studies, one of the trials that was identified and subsequently inserted aimed to analyse the incidence of HF. Papadaky et al. have conducted a recent secondary analysis of the pre-specified outcome of the PREDIMED trial with the aim of assessing whether TMD could influence the incidence of HF.

        Authors: Kluska, Woźniak
        Excerpt: "Polyphenols are biologically active compounds that are abundant in various parts of plants-fruits, leaves, roots and seeds. They show many health-promoting properties, mainly antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. Recently, there is an increasing interest in polyphenols in the treatment of different pathological states, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Many studies indicate the anti-cancer properties of polyphenols. Polyphenols exert their potential in anti-cancer therapy via promoting apoptosis and cell senescence, regulating autophagy, and inhibiting proliferation and migration of cancer cells. They can induce cellular stress and catabolism: through an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decrease in cellular antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH), interaction with chemotherapy agents and the reduction or reversal of multidrug resistance. Polyphenols can change epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as regulate non-coding miRNAs expression, which modulates gene expression. These epigenetic changes, which induce polyphenols and other phytochemicals, play a crucial role in cancer prevention and therapy. Recent studies indicate that polyphenols inhibit senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and form an anti-cancer microenvironment to prevent cancer. On the other hand, when tumorigenesis occurs, polyphenols are able to inhibit the cancer by the mechanisms of oncogene-, oxidative stress-, DNA damage response (DDR)-, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cancer cell senescence. Pro-senescence therapy is a recently proposed anti-cancer strategy and has been shown to effectively inhibit cancer. In the last twenty years, the number of publications on the possibility of using polyphenols in the treatment of cancer has increased significantly. There are several reasons for this increase in interest in polyphenols."

        The LLM should recognize that Mediterranean diet (or a similar diet rich in polyphenols or the DASH diet [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]) may help managing Rheumatoid Arthritis (here: EORA) or chronic inflammatory (metabolic) diseases, respectively. In comparison to their younger counterparts, individuals with EORA often show unusual symptoms such as higher incidence of rheumatoid factor and higher frequency of bone erosions. EORA can present itself in multiple types and is often characterized by a disease onset after the age of 60 and in rare cases disease onset can be shifted towards even higher age.
        The LLM could create a list which highlights how such a diet could help (by its effects on cardiovascular health, metabolism, …)  and could recommend supplementations (e.g. omega-3). It should also give a brief summary about potential interaction effects between the attended dietary regimen with current medication.

        Excerpt: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is described as highintensity exercise with intervals that are characterized by repeated sessions of high-intensity exercise period followed by rest or low-intensity exercise for recovery. For years, moderateintensity continuous training (MICT) has been the most preferred exercise modality for improving body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness. Long-term devotion to this training method has however been low as many people stop exercising as a result of lack of time. In comparison, HIIT is undoubtedly a time-efficient strategy to increase metabolism and enhance skeletal muscle capacity. HIIT is also less monotonous, thereby increasing participation and adherence. Furthermore, aerobically-based HIIT has been reported to extensively improve cardiorespiratory fitness-a strong determinant of morbidity and mortality - and to stimulate an increase of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations-a critical indicator for mental health. Additionally, aerobic HIIT leads to mitochondrial biogenesis and induces multiple factors involved in tissue regeneration. For decades, HIIT was primarily used in athletic practice for runners and swimmers . More recently, HIIT gained much attention for not only athletes but also as an effective exercise module in healthy adults in maintaining or enhancing body composition, body weight control and disease rehabilitation. However, most of these studies were carried out with young adults. Fewer studies have been done on older adults, especially healthy older adults. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the low risk and feasibility of HIIT in older adults. Highintensity exercise training program has shown well-tolerance in individuals of 45-80 years old with Parkinson's disease (95% adherence). Using animal models in exercise research has long provided insights into the physiologic adaptations to exercise.

        Excerpt: A human study also demonstrated that lifelong endurance training can preserve cardiac function at a level similar to that of young subjects, although the mechanism remains unknown [29]. One of our previous studies provided evidence that exercising induces Cisd2 expression, which improves mitochondrial function and restores a younger metabolic profile [28]. Therefore, it seems quite possible that exercising rejuvenates the aging heart via an upregulation of Cisd2 expression. In contrast to preclinical claims of structural and functional recovery after myocardial infarction (MI), cell therapy, when used with acute and chronic MI models, has been largely disappointing [30][31][32]. The results of clinical trials have failed to verify that cell therapy is able to restore heart function after injury [32]. Cardiac fibrosis has been recognized as the fundamental response of the heart to various injuries, including but not limited to inflammation, ischemia/reperfusion, and infection. Previous studies revealed that stress-induced increase in proinflammatory cytokines and profibrotic factors resulted in the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts accompanied with elevated secretion of collagens and other extracellular matrix proteins. Subsequently, the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix proteins led to cardiac remodeling with architecture distortion and cardiac dysfunction [33]. A recent alternative approach has been the development of cell therapy targeting cardiac fibrosis; this involves the adoptive transfer of T cells that target the fibroblast activation protein. This approach has been found to result in a significant reduction in cardiac fibrosis and restoration of cardiac function [34]. Senescent cells, which accumulate during aging, are known to disrupt cardiac structure and function [35] and represent another therapeutic target when preventing age-associated cardiac dysfunction [6].

        Excerpt: External pacing is a cardiac stress assay that paces hearts to twice their normal heartbeat, then measures the percentage of flies that undergo arrest following treatment [44]. The percentage of hearts that undergo arrest following pacing is highly age-dependent [45] and acts as a marker for overall cardiac health. Three-week old La flies have a lower failure rate than age-matched unexercised Ra flies ( Figure 2F) and do not receive further benefit from training ( Figure 2F). However, after three weeks of exercise training, Threeweek old Ra males had a similar failure rate to that of age-matched La males, indicating that exercise training in males can mimic the cardioprotective effect seen in La flies. Three-week old female Ra flies did not respond to training with significant improvement. Exercise training increases Lysotracker staining in adipose tissue, but not heart, of wild type male flies [26]. Lysotracker staining is also high in adipose tissue of three-week old La flies in both males and females, consistent with a genetic increase in fat-specific autophagy levels in the La line ( Figure 2G, H). In both the Ra and La lines, males showed a stronger physiological response to exercise training than females, a phenomenon that we have previously observed across genotypes. This difference is due to a dimorphic behavioral response to the exercise stimulus which will be described in a separate manuscript. Therefore, we concentrated on males for microarray analysis.  Brackets indicate genes that are members of both the glutathione metabolism and the metabolism of xenobiotics KEGG pathways. Gray upregulated genes are part of the KEGG folate biosynthesis pathway. Dots, crosses and stars indicate membership in downregulated KEGG pathways. Some genes are members of multiple pathways. Gray downregulated genes are members of the KEGG limonene/pinene degradation pathway.

        Excerpt: Cardiovascular patients frequently present low levels of cardiovascular function, muscle mass, and muscle strength. Aerobic and resistance exercise as part of cardiac rehabilitation can reduce these deficits [1,2]. Because high-intensity exercise increases the risk of arrhythmias and can exacerbate existing heart failures [3], the intensity of aerobic exercise is kept below anaerobic threshold during cardiac rehabilitation [4]. During conventional cardiac rehabilitation, patients perform aerobic exercise on ergometers or treadmills, and exercise intensity is set based on cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Indeed, light intensity aerobic exercise tends to improve cardiopulmonary function, but this intensity is insufficient to improve muscle strength and mass [5]. Therefore, light-intensity exercise programs, which can also improve muscle strength and mass, are needed to safely facilitate cardiovascular patients' rehabilitation. Short-term, low-intensity exercise with blood flow restriction (BFR) versus exercise without BFR of a limb muscle increases the gains in muscle strength and mass in athletes and healthy adults [6,7]. The potential physiological mechanism underlying low-intensity exercise with BFR to improve muscle strength and mass is an increase in metabolic stress, which theoretically activates systemic hormone production and fast-twitch muscle fibers [8]. A clinical study also reported that low-intensity resistance training with BFR can increase lower limb muscle strength and mass in cardiovascular patients [9]. However, the effects of BFR on muscle activation during low-intensity exercise in cardiovascular patients are still unknown. Because exercise with BFR vs. exercise without BFR has the potential to augment muscle activation, which can be recorded noninvasively by electromyography (EMG), it is relevant to determine the effects of BFR on EMG activity in cardiovascular patients.

      summary: |-
        Given that the individual does not provide information on a potentially existing Heart Failure, ejection fraction or device implantations, it would be best practice for the LLM to recommend supervised medium intensity training or supervised cardiac rehabilitation programs. 
        Intervention studies and meta analyses showed a beneficial effect of post MI HIIT training in individuals with HFmrEF and HFpEF (Heart Failure with mildly reduced and preserved Ejection Fraction, respectively) or low-risk individuals, whereas other studies showed no superior effects to MCE (moderate continuous training) in HFrEF.  HIIT can improve VO2peak or exercise capacity in post-MI individuals and is considered safe when performed under supervision (cardiovascular rehabilitation program). However, the “2020 ESC Guidelines on sports cardiology and exercise in individuals with cardiovascular disease” recommends HIIT (only) for low-risk individuals (pp. 44-45).
        Thus, the LLM should recommend training under supervision after the individual underwent a thorough baseline evaluation of his cardiovascular condition 5. The initial training regimen could consist of moderate continuous exercise training (MCE) combined with frequent aerobic exercise and resistance training.

        Title: Rasburicase represents a new tool for hyperuricemia in tumor lysis syn- drome and in gout
        Open-Access-URL: http://www.medsci.org/v04p0083.pdf
        Authors: Cammalleri, Malaguarnera
        Excerpt: Uric acid is a weak organic acid (pKa 5.8), poorly water-soluble at acidic pH. It derives partly from diet and partly from endogenous biosynthesis and it is eliminated by enteric (25-35%) and renal (65-75%) ways. We define hyperuricemia the uric acid blood level over 8 mg/dl (4.76 µmol/l). The impact of hyperuricemia is wide felt because it may cause pathologic consequences in several organs, such as kidney, brain, subcutaneous tissue, joints. Many studies underline the direct proportionality between serum urate and risk of gout. Hyperuricemia, in fact, is considered its biochemical hallmark, because the precipitation of uric acid is possible when uric acid exceeds the limit of solubility (about 4.20 µmol/l at 37º C). Gout attack is one of the most painful situations suffered by humans, owing to the crystallization of uric acid within joints with the consequent intermittent attacks of arthritis. The tophaceous gout is the chronic and insidious evolution that happens after 10 or more years. It is characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate (tophi) in soft tissues around joints, in kidney and in subcutaneous tissue. Kidney is one of the most involved organs in case of hyperuricemia, because it is the main site of uric acid excretion. Its impairment may be of different types. Hyperuricemia is a cause of urolithiasis. Calculi predominantly composed of uric acid represent around 13% of human kidney stones. It is possible also an acute urate nephropathy, due to a dramatic and rapid increase of uricemia and renal handling of uric acid and urate. The crystals precipitate and obstruct tubules of distal nephrons and collecting ducts, where pH is acidic. The result is a tubular necrosis and acute renal failure (ARF) because of intrarenal obstruction of urinary flow.

        Authors: Kang, Ha
        Excerpt: Hyperuricemia may also result from diets high in purines, from ethanol, and from fructose. The effect of alcohol is in part related to increased urate synthesis, which is due to enhanced turnover of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA as part of the metabolism of ethanol. In addition, acute alcohol consumption causes lactate production, and because lactate is an antiuricosuric agent, it will reduce renal urate excretion and exacerbate hyperuricemia. Fructose (a simple sugar present in sucrose, table sugar, high fructose corn syrup, honey, and fruits) can also induce a rapid rise in serum uric acid, due in part to its rapid phosphorylation in hepatocytes with the stimulation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase and ATP consumption. Chronic fructose consumption also stimulates uric acid synthesis. It has been proposed that the marked increase in fructose intake may have a role in the rising levels of serum uric acid and obesity worldwide. Uric acid may also be affected by exercise, with moderate exercise reducing urate levels (probably by increasing renal blood flow) and severe exercise causing a rise in uric acid (probably due to ATP consumption with adenosine and xanthine formation). What happens first when cells are exposed to uric acid? One of the earliest phenomena observed in uric acidexposed cells is the generation of oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known to be associated with local inflammation, an impairment of nitric oxide (NO) generation, an activation of the renin-angiotensin system, insulin resistance and fat accumulation. Uric acid-induced ROS production seems paradoxical since uric acid has generally been considered to be one of the important anti-oxidants that protect the cardiovascular system from oxidative stress.

        Title: Dietary Control of Inflammation and Resolution

        Authors: Sears, Saha
        Excerpt: "The net result is a reduction in the intensity of the inflammatory response. Another reason for increasing the omega-3 levels in an antiinflammatory diet is the reduction of inflammasome activation. Inflammasomes are intracellular structures formed in response to microbe-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) sensed within the cell. Once activated, inflammasomes will cause the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. The NLRP3 inflammasome is the most investigated of the various inflammasomes. Omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA can inhibit the activation of inflammasomes. However, it appears that DHA may be more effective than EPA in this regard. Finally, an anti-inflammatory diet should reduce the inflammatory effects of metabolic endotoxemia by strengthening the mucosal barrier in the gut. Improvement in the integrity of the gut's tight junctions can result from the increased levels of the bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila. The population of this bacterium in the gut can be enhanced with an increased intake of fermentable fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols. The dietary foundation for reducing diet-induced inflammation would consist of the following nutritional composition: calorie restriction with adequate protein coupled with a moderate level of low glycemic-load carbohydrates to reduce excess glucose intake. Furthermore, the diet should be low in total fat (especially omega-6 and saturated fatty acids), yet with sufficient levels of fermentable fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols. Reducing the inflammation caused by an injury is only the first step toward the ultimate healing of any tissue damage. The second obligatory step of the Resolution Response is resolving any residual inflammation. Unlike the variety of dietary interventions that help reduce inflammation, increasing resolution of any residual inflammation is purely a function of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet that are the building blocks to produce levels of adequate Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs)."

        Authors: Kluska, Woźniak
        Excerpt: "Polyphenols are biologically active compounds that are abundant in various parts of plants-fruits, leaves, roots and seeds. They show many health-promoting properties, mainly antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. Recently, there is an increasing interest in polyphenols in the treatment of different pathological states, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Many studies indicate the anti-cancer properties of polyphenols. Polyphenols exert their potential in anti-cancer therapy via promoting apoptosis and cell senescence, regulating autophagy, and inhibiting proliferation and migration of cancer cells. They can induce cellular stress and catabolism: through an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decrease in cellular antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH), interaction with chemotherapy agents and the reduction or reversal of multidrug resistance. Polyphenols can change epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as regulate non-coding miRNAs expression, which modulates gene expression. These epigenetic changes, which induce polyphenols and other phytochemicals, play a crucial role in cancer prevention and therapy. Recent studies indicate that polyphenols inhibit senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and form an anti-cancer microenvironment to prevent cancer. On the other hand, when tumorigenesis occurs, polyphenols are able to inhibit the cancer by the mechanisms of oncogene-, oxidative stress-, DNA damage response (DDR)-, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cancer cell senescence. Pro-senescence therapy is a recently proposed anti-cancer strategy and has been shown to effectively inhibit cancer. In the last twenty years, the number of publications on the possibility of using polyphenols in the treatment of cancer has increased significantly. There are several reasons for this increase in interest in polyphenols."

        Excerpt: External pacing is a cardiac stress assay that paces hearts to twice their normal heartbeat, then measures the percentage of flies that undergo arrest following treatment [44]. The percentage of hearts that undergo arrest following pacing is highly age-dependent [45] and acts as a marker for overall cardiac health. Three-week old La flies have a lower failure rate than age-matched unexercised Ra flies ( Figure 2F) and do not receive further benefit from training ( Figure 2F). However, after three weeks of exercise training, Threeweek old Ra males had a similar failure rate to that of age-matched La males, indicating that exercise training in males can mimic the cardioprotective effect seen in La flies. Three-week old female Ra flies did not respond to training with significant improvement. Exercise training increases Lysotracker staining in adipose tissue, but not heart, of wild type male flies [26]. Lysotracker staining is also high in adipose tissue of three-week old La flies in both males and females, consistent with a genetic increase in fat-specific autophagy levels in the La line ( Figure 2G, H). In both the Ra and La lines, males showed a stronger physiological response to exercise training than females, a phenomenon that we have previously observed across genotypes. This difference is due to a dimorphic behavioral response to the exercise stimulus which will be described in a separate manuscript. Therefore, we concentrated on males for microarray analysis.  Brackets indicate genes that are members of both the glutathione metabolism and the metabolism of xenobiotics KEGG pathways. Gray upregulated genes are part of the KEGG folate biosynthesis pathway. Dots, crosses and stars indicate membership in downregulated KEGG pathways. Some genes are members of multiple pathways. Gray downregulated genes are members of the KEGG limonene/pinene degradation pathway.

        Excerpt: Cardiovascular patients frequently present low levels of cardiovascular function, muscle mass, and muscle strength. Aerobic and resistance exercise as part of cardiac rehabilitation can reduce these deficits [1,2]. Because high-intensity exercise increases the risk of arrhythmias and can exacerbate existing heart failures [3], the intensity of aerobic exercise is kept below anaerobic threshold during cardiac rehabilitation [4]. During conventional cardiac rehabilitation, patients perform aerobic exercise on ergometers or treadmills, and exercise intensity is set based on cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Indeed, light intensity aerobic exercise tends to improve cardiopulmonary function, but this intensity is insufficient to improve muscle strength and mass [5]. Therefore, light-intensity exercise programs, which can also improve muscle strength and mass, are needed to safely facilitate cardiovascular patients' rehabilitation. Short-term, low-intensity exercise with blood flow restriction (BFR) versus exercise without BFR of a limb muscle increases the gains in muscle strength and mass in athletes and healthy adults [6,7]. The potential physiological mechanism underlying low-intensity exercise with BFR to improve muscle strength and mass is an increase in metabolic stress, which theoretically activates systemic hormone production and fast-twitch muscle fibers [8]. A clinical study also reported that low-intensity resistance training with BFR can increase lower limb muscle strength and mass in cardiovascular patients [9]. However, the effects of BFR on muscle activation during low-intensity exercise in cardiovascular patients are still unknown. Because exercise with BFR vs. exercise without BFR has the potential to augment muscle activation, which can be recorded noninvasively by electromyography (EMG), it is relevant to determine the effects of BFR on EMG activity in cardiovascular patients.

        For this individual the LLM should recognize that starting with HIIT training is contraindicated due to the individual's characteristics: elevated resting heart rate, elevated resting blood pressure, and clear signs of a poorly controlled Heart Failure: ankle swelling (edema), shortness of breath and muscle fatigue. Given these symptoms, the reported ejection fraction (EF) is even worse. When attempting HIIT without baseline evaluation by a specialized physician and/or without professional supervision the individual might face a high risk for developing even more severe symptoms and an exacerbation or decompensation of his Heart Failure.
        The LLM could recommend supervised moderate training with focus on moderate aerobic exercises or resistance training after thorough evaluation by a physician and treatment of the present symptoms and issues. Only when the individual's response to the intervention is positive (managed blood pressure, heart rate etc.) the intensity could be increased under supervision and frequent health monitoring.

        Excerpt: Menopause, the transition from the reproductive to non-reproductive stage, is a complex physiological process, often accompanied by additional effects of aging (Nelson 2008). In addition to reproductive viability, deterioration in musculoskeletal properties begins to accumulate (Kallman et al. 1990; Phillips et al. 1993; Samson et al. 2000), which may lead to severe consequences for the quality of life and the ability to recover from physical traumas ultimately reducing the healthspan of women. Therefore, early preventative actions to maintain adequate muscle performance in later life are needed. So far the best prevention strategy against agingrelated weakness is physical exercise (Greenlund and Nair 2003; Taaffe 2006). Strength, endurance, and power training have been found to exhibit beneficial albeit differential effects on aging musculature (e.g., Hoppeler et al. 1985; Häkkinen et al. 2000; Roth et al. 2001; Timmons et al. 2005; Porter 2006; Hazell et al. 2007;Henwood et al. 2008; Orsatti et al. 2008). Progressive power training such as undertaken in the current study, is associated with enhanced quality of life, i.e., physical functioning and well-being (Katula et al. 2008), neuromuscular functions involving rapid force production (Sipilä et al. 2001; Taaffe et al. 2005), and bone formation (Cheng et al. 2002). Moreover, muscle power is essential for many daily tasks such as climbing stairs, rising from chair, and preventing a fall after a slip leading a number of recent studies (Hazell et al. 2007; Paterson et al. 2007; Katula et al. 2008; Orr et al. 2008) to conclude that strategies improving muscle power and composition are essential in order to prevent old age disability. Therefore, power training is promising training mode for postmenopausal women whose risk for osteoporosis and neuromuscular dysfunction might otherwise be increased.

        Excerpt: The postmenopausal period typically occupies one-third of a woman's life, and it is estimated that by the year 2020, more than 46 million women in the United States (U.S.) will be postmenopausal. Menopause is associated with the development of numerous chronic diseases, due to an abrupt cessation of ovarian hormone production, namely estrogen. Osteoporosis is a chronic and debilitating age-related skeletal disease characterized by the loss of bone mass and a deterioration of the microstructural properties of bone, resulting in an increased propensity for fragility fractures. Osteoporosis is responsible for more than 1.5 million fractures per year in the U.S., with most occurring in postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis and its related bone fractures are a major public health concern as they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, a poor quality of life, and a large economic burden. Approximately 44 million men and women over the age of 50 have osteoporosis or low bone mass in the U.S.. Diminished estrogen levels associated with menopause result in an initial phase of rapid bone loss, followed by a period of a slower deterioration of the skeleton. This rapid phase of bone loss occurs within the first five to 10 years following the cessation of menses or the surgical removal of the ovaries. As the demographic shifts to a more aged population, the prevalence and incidence of osteoporosis are likely to continue to increase, with affected individuals being at a greater risk of falls, fragility fractures, and therefore morbidity and mortality. As such, therapeutic strategies that can delay, slow down, or prevent bone loss in aging individuals, and particularly in postmenopausal women, are critically needed. Hormone replacement therapy is a logical therapeutic strategy for postmenopausal women since age-related chronic disease development typically begins after the cessation of ovarian hormone production.

        Excerpt: Primary nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fat and lipoprotein, protein and polypeptide, vitamins, and phytoestrogens, have displayed huge potential and enjoyable outcomes in the application for menopausal intervention of POI, both in animal and clinical studies. The dietary nutrients may delay the menopause by affecting various aspects, from improving ovarian viability and function directly to counteracting oxidative stress, inflammation, aging and systemic endocrinal disorders. A latest meta-analysis suggested an association between POI and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Anagnostis et al., 2019). There is increasing evidence indicating that the gut microbiota is included in the pathophysiological process of insulin resistance. Thus, it leads to the progression of T2DM via influencing the contents of some vital metabolites. Nevertheless, it remains to be further validated whether modification of gut microbiota in POI patients results in serum metabolites out of balance, which in turn predisposes to menopause manifestation and related health concerns. Moreover, the therapeutic effects were not consistent in all researches and even among different time points in a single research study. This indicates the individual difference is significant and further work should be emphasized on precision nutrition with individual nutrient needs for optimal female reproduction, like POI treatment. Still, microbial nutrition is rarely discussed in POI patients or animals, possibly due to the unclear pathogenesis of POI. Especially, the correlation between probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics and POI remains poorly investigated. It should also be a major theme to work on in the future. From the present work, dietary and microbial nutrients are important and promising for regulating female reproductive disorder, like POI, and therefore, optimal lifestyle intervention by diet is promising and deserves more efforts and attention to provide better and healthier life for female individuals.

        Excerpt: The National Osteoporosis Foundation estimates that one in every two women and one in every five men over will experience osteoporosis-related fractures during their lifetime. The loss of estrogen in menopause leads to a decline in bone mineral density (BMD). It has been reported that not only in women but also in men there is an association between low estradiol levels and increased fracture. Thus, low estradiol is a key factor predicting bone loss in older adults. In addition to low estradiol, low serum 25(OH)D 3 is also associated with adverse skeletal outcomes. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include older age, inadequate exposure to sunlight, dark skin tone, and obesity. Vitamin D deficiency, which is common among the elderly, causes secondary hyperparathyroidism that can result in decreased bone density and increased risk of fracture. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of postmenopausal white women with 25(OH)D levels of 20 ng·mL − 1 or less, Gallagher et al. reported that a vitamin D dose of 800 IU per day (in conjunction with sufficient calcium intake; 1 200-1 400 mg) increased 25(OH)D levels greater than 20 ng·mL − 1 in 97.5% of the women. This level, as indicated by the Institute of Medicine, is associated with reduced fracture risk. It should be noted, however, that some studies have suggested that a threshold of 30 ng·mL − 1 is preferable to maintain skeletal health. Some individuals, however, do not respond to vitamin D supplementation with an increase in 25(OH)D. The factors controlling this lack of response are unknown. It has recently been shown that DNA methylation levels of CYP2R1 and CYP24A1 are higher in non-responders, suggesting that the DNA methylation levels of these enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism may predict which patients will not respond to vitamin D. The current standard recommended daily doses of vitamin D and calcium are 800 IU and 1 000 mg, respectively, for vitamin D-sufficient individuals.

        Excerpt: Dietary fiber includes polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, lignin and associated plant substances. Studies indicate that fiber intake can reduce the risk of COPD due its anti-inflammatory effect, since systemic inflammation is an important feature of COPD. Increased dietary fiber intake has been linked to reduced systemic inflammation and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Considering that CRP is a marker of systemic inflammation activated by the innate immune system and a possible molecule associated with vascular disease, it is possible that its action is related to lung damage. High-fiber diets were also able to reduce mortality from infectious or inflammatory diseases (50% reduction), respiratory diseases (60% reduction), and smokingrelated cancers (25% reduction). Dietary fibers can also modify the intestinal microbiota, especially interfering with the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. As a result, there is an increase in short-chain fatty acids that are derived from the fermentation of dietary fibers. These fatty acids have relevant protection in the regulation of neutrophils, lung function and COPD, and epithelial protection against infection. According to the European Food Safety Authority, the current recommendation for dietary fiber intake is 25 g/day. Most of the lipid mediators that regulate inflammation are metabolites from omega-6 (ω-6) or omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acids, including arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. ω-3 and ω-6 are considered essential fatty acids, as the body is not able to produce them, and their acquisition through diet is necessary. Most vegetable oils are significant sources of ω-6, while cold-water marine fish are the main sources of ω-3. Generally, ω-6 fatty acids are proinflammatory, and ω-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory.

        Excerpt: "Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention in which calorie intake is reduced without malnutrition. CR is consid-ered the most robust nongenetic method for increasing life span and has been shown to be effective in yeast, worms, flies, mice, rats, and nonhuman primates. CR induces a host of physiological changes, including reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduced core body temperature, and reduced global cell proliferation rates. It is unknown whether these physiological effects are connected to the CR-dependent prevention of age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease in mammalian model systems. Beyond the prevention of disease, CR reduces age-related declines in cognitive function and the development of sarcopenia. Although CR-dependent reductions in disease and increased longevity were first demonstrated in rats 75 years ago, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not fully understood. Two apparently contradictory mechanisms have been proposed to explain how CR reduces the accumulation of damaged proteins: 1) increased protein replacement resulting in less oxidative damage, or 2) decreased protein turnover due to lower demand for protein replacement. The first suggests that CR is similar to short-term starvation, which induces autophagy and lysosomal proteolysis in cells. Several researchers have reported that chronic CR increases protein degradation, including autophagic digestion of mitochondria, removing damaged proteins while increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and replacement with new proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, CR-dependent increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and increased autophagy or protein catabolism have been reported. Yet, to date, no study has assessed the turnover of autophagic substrates (e.g. mitochondrial proteins) in calorie-restricted mammals."

        Authors: Coletti, Stevenson Moylan, Berardi, Piccirillo
        Excerpt: "Physical exercise is among the ways by which muscles may be protected against disease-induced muscle wasting. Physical activity can be grossly divided into two types: aerobic (or endurance) and anaerobic (or strength) exercise. The former shifts muscle fiber types toward those with increased capacity for aerobic metabolism and better ability to resist fatigue, due to a larger number of mitochondria and vessels (types I and IIA fibers), this is typical in runners, long-distance cross-country skiers, bicyclists, swimmers. These fibers contract slowly with a low peak force and generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids. The second type of exercise causes hypertrophy, especially of myofibers IIX (and IIB in rodents), due to enhanced synthesis of contractile proteins, resulting in increased strength with no change in the number of mitochondria (typically occurring in weight-lifters and body-builders). These fibers generate fast contractions with a high peak force, and metabolize phosphocreatine and glucose anaerobically to make ATP. Aerobic exercise induces in humans and in rodents the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1-α). PGC1-α not only promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, contrasting the propensity to fatigue of cachectic muscles, but also directly antagonizes protein catabolism by blocking FoxO3, the master transcription factor coordinating both proteasomal and lysosomal protein degradation. As a result, oxidative fibers are more resistant to cancer-induced atrophy than glycolytic ones, typically enlarged upon muscle adaptation to anaerobic exercise."

        Authors: Kluska, Woźniak
        Excerpt: "Polyphenols are biologically active compounds that are abundant in various parts of plants-fruits, leaves, roots and seeds. They show many health-promoting properties, mainly antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. Recently, there is an increasing interest in polyphenols in the treatment of different pathological states, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Many studies indicate the anti-cancer properties of polyphenols. Polyphenols exert their potential in anti-cancer therapy via promoting apoptosis and cell senescence, regulating autophagy, and inhibiting proliferation and migration of cancer cells. They can induce cellular stress and catabolism: through an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decrease in cellular antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH), interaction with chemotherapy agents and the reduction or reversal of multidrug resistance. Polyphenols can change epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as regulate non-coding miRNAs expression, which modulates gene expression. These epigenetic changes, which induce polyphenols and other phytochemicals, play a crucial role in cancer prevention and therapy. Recent studies indicate that polyphenols inhibit senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and form an anti-cancer microenvironment to prevent cancer. On the other hand, when tumorigenesis occurs, polyphenols are able to inhibit the cancer by the mechanisms of oncogene-, oxidative stress-, DNA damage response (DDR)-, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cancer cell senescence. Pro-senescence therapy is a recently proposed anti-cancer strategy and has been shown to effectively inhibit cancer. In the last twenty years, the number of publications on the possibility of using polyphenols in the treatment of cancer has increased significantly. There are several reasons for this increase in interest in polyphenols."

        Excerpt: Spermidine is a natural polyamine present in all living organisms that is critically involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. This chemical affects numerous biological processes, including cell growth and proliferation, tissue regeneration, DNA and RNA stabilization, enzymatic modulation, and regulation of translation, among others. Furthermore, spermidine exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, enhances mitochondrial metabolic function and respiration, promotes chaperone activity and improves proteostasis. Intriguingly, external supplementation of spermidine exerts various beneficial effects on aging and age-related disease in a variety of model organisms, including mice. For example, spermidine feeding extends lifespan across species, promotes cardio-and neuroprotection, stimulates antineoplastic immune response and may avoid immunosenescence by stimulating memory T-cell formation. Many of these antiaging properties have been causally linked to the capacity of spermidine to ensure proteostasis through the stimulation of cytoprotective macroautophagy. Age-associated conditions including cancer, neurodegeneration and cardiovascular diseases are directly connected to the intracellular accumulation of toxic debris, and its removal by autophagy constitutes a well-documented avenue for protection against age and disease. Spermidine induces autophagy through the inhibition of several acetyltransferases, including EP300, one of the main negative regulators of autophagy. Its potency has been recently quantified to be equivalent to that of rapamycin, an FDA-approved immunosuppressant with protective and autophagy-stimulatory properties. Importantly, the genetic impairment of autophagy abrogates the beneficial effects of spermidine on longevity of yeast, flies and worms.

        Excerpt: The polyamine spermidine is essential for protein translation in eukaryotes, both as a substrate for the hypusination of the translation initiation factor eIF5A as well as general translational fidelity. Dwindling spermidine levels during aging have been implicated in reduced immune cell function through insufficient eIF5A hypusination, which can be restored by external supplementation. Recent findings characterize a group of novel Mendelian disorders linked to EIF5A missense and nonsense variants that cause protein translation defects. In model organisms that recapitulate these mutations, spermidine supplementation was able to alleviate at least some of the concomitant protein translation defects. Here, we discuss the role of spermidine in protein translation and possible therapeutic avenues for translation-associated disorders. Spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine that is strongly involved in manifold cellular processes, for example, DNA, RNA and protein stabilization, cell growth, proliferation, autophagy, and aging. Importantly, spermidine has also been connected to the modulation of general protein translation, and specifically also to the control of the translation factor eIF5A. This translation initiation factor features a unique amino acid derivative called hypusine, which is synthesized by the transfer of the 4-amino butyl moiety of spermidine to the ε-amino group of lysine 50 through the enzymes deoxyhypusine synthase and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. As this modification is essential for normal eIF5A function, insufficient hypusination results in dysfunctional translation of eIF5A targets, in particular proteins that contain polyproline tract (PPT) motifs. In detail, hypusinated eIF5A resolves ribosomal stalling that occurs at PPT motifs by entering the ribosomal E site when a diproline peptide is bound to the tRNA at the ribosomal P-site. The hypusine residue directly interacts with the acceptor stem of the P-site tRNA and reorients it to overcome the sterical restrictions imposed by the imino acid proline.

        Excerpt: A decrease in polyamines has long been documented as occurring in mammalian cell cultures and human organs during aging. In 2009, work by Eisenberg et al. (2009) showed that the exogenous addition of spermidine extended lifespan in yeast, fly, worm, and human cells. Spermidine also reduced age-related oxidative stress in mice. By contrast, polyamine depletion decreased yeast lifespan and increased ROS production and necrosis. The authors observed a correlation between spermidine-induced longevity and the hypoacetylation of histone H3, which led to the upregulation of the autophagy genes ATG7, ATG11, and ATG15 and promoted autophagy in all the model organisms tested, which was shown to be crucial for polyamine-enhanced longevity. The beneficial effects of spermidine supplementation on aging were also reported in different organisms, in relation to different age-related aspects connected to the promotion of autophagy, but also independently. Spermidine was proven to ameliorate cardiovascular aging, improve memory, and reduce cancer mortality, among other beneficial effects. The mediation of spermidine effects through induced hypusination of eIF5A has recently been shown in studies of B-cell immunity in older adults. Spermidine-promoted eIF5A hypusination restored B-cell immunity in old mice through the promotion of autophagy. Hyp-eIF5A maintained autophagy through the translation of the autophagy transcription factor TFEB, which contains polyproline motifs in its amino acid sequence. During aging, there is a decline in TFEB levels, together with those of hyp-eIF5A and spermidine, leading to failures in the immune system. Intriguingly, a proteomic analysis conducted in this study with primary B-cells treated with GC7 showed a reduced expression of TFEB, but not of the previously shown mammalian and Caenorhabditis elegans autophagy eIF5A target ATG3, suggesting the influence of the cellular context.

        Excerpt: Such spermidine-rich food items comprise unprocessed plant-derived foods including the durian fruit, shitake mushrooms, fresh green pepper, wheat germ, amaranth grain, cauliflower and broccoli, just to mention a few, but also products resulting from fermentation processes that involve polyamine-generating bacteria and fungi, e.g. soybean products such as natto or many types of mature cheese. Therefore, the systemic levels of spermidine are influenced by diet either directly, by the ingestion of polyamine-rich food items, or indirectly, by effects of the diet on the spermidine-producing microbiota. The use of a spermidine-rich diet to elevate systemic spermidine levels in human organs may constitute a promising strategy for promoting healthy aging. Spermidine shows no adverse effects during life-long administration in mice, and a currently ongoing clinical trial on supplementation of spermidine-rich plant extracts to elderly persons indicates good safety and tolerability. Recently, for the first time, an epidemiological study has reported a positive association between nutritional spermidine uptake and human health span and lifespan. A total of 829 participants aged 45-84 were observed over a time frame of 15 years, during which 341 became deceased. The spermidine uptake of each participant was calculated based on food-frequency questionnaires every 5 years. Individuals with high total nutritional spermidine uptake displayed a reduced incidence of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, correlating with an overall improved survival. This was even the case after correction for possibly confounding factors such as age, sex, body mass index, alcohol and aspirin consumption, dietary quality, metabolic diseases, physical activity, and socioeconomic status. Importantly, the association between high dietary spermidine uptake and reduced mortality has been recapitulated in a second, independent cohort of 1770 healthy participants aged 39-67 with a medium follow-up of 13 years. However, one limitation of the aforementioned epidemiological studies resides in the absence of laboratory assessments of spermidine concentrations.

        Open-Access-URL: https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.100481
        Authors: Tucci, Tucci
        Excerpt: Caloric restriction (CR), that is limiting food intake, is recognized in mammals as the best characterized and most reproducible strategy for extending lifespan, retarding physiological aging and delaying the onset of age-associated diseases. Restricted calorie intake modifies the rate of aging and cellular pathology, reduces the age-associated accumulation of oxidatively damaged proteins, lipids and DNA and also prevents many of the changes in gene expression and transcriptional activity that normally occur with ageing. Although several theories have been advanced over the years to explain the anti-ageing effects of CR, one favoured hypothesis is that CR acts by decreasing oxidative stress. Biologically, different animal species are characterised by markedly different lifespan. For example, mice have relatively short (around 2-year) mean longevity, whereas humans live to a mean of 70-80 years. Animals with higher metabolic rates often have shorter life spans. The higher the metabolic rate of an organism, the greater the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hence the shorter the lifespan; however, in some species the strict correlation between metabolic rate and life span is not maintained. Birds and primates, for example, tend to live longer than would be predicted by their metabolic rates. This is because, at a given metabolic rate, mitochondria from these species tend to produce fewer ROS. Thus the accumulation of molecular damage and the resulting increase of oxidative stress caused by ROS was thought to contribute to aging rather than metabolic rate itself and provided the strongest correlation with overall longevity. More recently, however, became evident that the ROS model cannot be the only driving-force of aging. No animal lives long enough to experience the consequences of damage by ROS, since other factors terminate its life first.

        Excerpt: "Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention in which calorie intake is reduced without malnutrition. CR is consid-ered the most robust nongenetic method for increasing life span and has been shown to be effective in yeast, worms, flies, mice, rats, and nonhuman primates. CR induces a host of physiological changes, including reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduced core body temperature, and reduced global cell proliferation rates. It is unknown whether these physiological effects are connected to the CR-dependent prevention of age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease in mammalian model systems. Beyond the prevention of disease, CR reduces age-related declines in cognitive function and the development of sarcopenia. Although CR-dependent reductions in disease and increased longevity were first demonstrated in rats 75 years ago, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not fully understood. Two apparently contradictory mechanisms have been proposed to explain how CR reduces the accumulation of damaged proteins: 1) increased protein replacement resulting in less oxidative damage, or 2) decreased protein turnover due to lower demand for protein replacement. The first suggests that CR is similar to short-term starvation, which induces autophagy and lysosomal proteolysis in cells. Several researchers have reported that chronic CR increases protein degradation, including autophagic digestion of mitochondria, removing damaged proteins while increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and replacement with new proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, CR-dependent increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and increased autophagy or protein catabolism have been reported. Yet, to date, no study has assessed the turnover of autophagic substrates (e.g. mitochondrial proteins) in calorie-restricted mammals."

        Authors: Coletti, Stevenson Moylan, Berardi, Piccirillo
        Excerpt: "Physical exercise is among the ways by which muscles may be protected against disease-induced muscle wasting. Physical activity can be grossly divided into two types: aerobic (or endurance) and anaerobic (or strength) exercise. The former shifts muscle fiber types toward those with increased capacity for aerobic metabolism and better ability to resist fatigue, due to a larger number of mitochondria and vessels (types I and IIA fibers), this is typical in runners, long-distance cross-country skiers, bicyclists, swimmers. These fibers contract slowly with a low peak force and generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids. The second type of exercise causes hypertrophy, especially of myofibers IIX (and IIB in rodents), due to enhanced synthesis of contractile proteins, resulting in increased strength with no change in the number of mitochondria (typically occurring in weight-lifters and body-builders). These fibers generate fast contractions with a high peak force, and metabolize phosphocreatine and glucose anaerobically to make ATP. Aerobic exercise induces in humans and in rodents the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1-α). PGC1-α not only promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, contrasting the propensity to fatigue of cachectic muscles, but also directly antagonizes protein catabolism by blocking FoxO3, the master transcription factor coordinating both proteasomal and lysosomal protein degradation. As a result, oxidative fibers are more resistant to cancer-induced atrophy than glycolytic ones, typically enlarged upon muscle adaptation to anaerobic exercise."

        Excerpt: "Current literature indicates that the risk of many cancers is decreased by reducing lifestyle factors such as smoking, high fat, meat, refined sugar diets, and physical inactivity Diet and age-related diseases (Barnard 2004). Randomized controlled trials over 3 years have demonstrated that lifestyle changes (weight loss if overweight, increased physical activity, moderate alcohol intake, diet high in fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and low sodium) have a blood pressure lowering effect similar to that seen with drug therapy (Krousel-Wood et al 2004). The SENECA study of 2600 elderly people in Europe born 1913-1918 and studied over 10 years starting in 1988, reported that a healthy lifestyle at older ages (70+ years) is able to delay the deterioration of health status and reduces mortality (de Groot et al 2004). Dietary modifications that have been shown in clinical trials to delay the onset of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, osteoporosis, and age-related macular degeneration are summarized in Table 2. A number of diets have been found to reduce mortality and prolong life. To achieve a degree of calorie restriction without malnutrition the choice is a low-energy diet with high nutrient density. Such a diet could consist of vegetables, fruits, low-fat milk products, whole grain cereals, and legumes (Elmadfa and Freisling 2005). Tubers such as potatoes and cassava should not be included in fruits and vegetables (Report of a Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation 2003). The main benefits of the fruit and vegetable diets are the lower intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal proteins, as well as the higher intakes of complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C and E, carotenoids, and other phytochemicals (Leitzmann 2005).

        Excerpt: With increasing aging populations, studies regarding aging have become an emerging field. Aging is the process of tissue deterioration coupled with an enormous economic burden. Osteosarcopenia is an age-related pathological condition characterized by porous and fragile bone and sarcopenia (a disease exhibiting low muscle mass and function), recognized as a "hazardous duet, " which induces fragile bones and increased risk of fractures, thus leading to high mortality rates and global financial threat. Binkley and Buehring (2009) first coined Sarco-Osteopenia to diagnose simultaneous bone and muscle weakness, calling for scientists to investigate specific mechanisms of the co-existence of osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Fat infiltration is a common character of aged bone and muscle; besides, osteoporosis and sarcopenia share several genetic, developmental, and endocrine factors. Endocrine factors have become a hot spot for studying the pathogenesis of osteosarcopenia, especially regarding myokines and osteokines. Myokines, defined as soluble molecules expressed and released by muscle fibers, regulate the biological and pathological activities of local and distant cells and organs. McPherron et al. (1997) identified the first myokine, i.e., myostatin, which is expressed in developing and mature muscle and negatively regulates muscle mass. Steensberg et al. (2000) reported that contracting muscle releases interleukin-6 into the bloodstream, and realized that muscle could function as an endocrine organ. Moreover, with the development of modern sequencing and analytic technology, about 672 myokines were identified (Grube et al., 2018). They are composed mainly of peptides, such as growth factors, cytokines, and some small organic acids. Various myokines in the circulation work together to maintain homeostasis via muscle-organ crosstalk (Das et al., 2020). For example, contracting muscle secretes brain-derived neurotrophic factors to improve the memory and learning capacity, and exercise-induced irisin was reported to promote thermogenesis and increase bone mass.

        Excerpt: Nearly half of the overall bone loss in women is experienced during the first 10 years after menopause. According to the WHO criteria, bone loss is defined by the so-called "T-score", a standardized measure that compares BMD to the average values of young healthy women. Indeed, osteopenia is defined by a T-score between −1 and −2.5 while osteoporosis by a T-score ≤-2.5. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are also too prevalent conditions during aging. Not surprisingly, osteoporosis and sarcopenia frequently occur simultaneously, even leading to the creation of a so-called "osteosarcopenia" condition. Like every other age-related condition, osteoporosis and sarcopenia show a common background in the biology of aging. To date, physical inactivity, as well as nutritional deficiencies, may lead to a decline of both tissues. Additionally, inflammatory states, endocrine alterations, fat infiltration, metabolic derangements, vitamin D deficiency, comorbidities, and genetic factors are all involved in the pathogenesis of both conditions (i.e., muscle and bone loss). Interestingly, it has been reported that genetic traits determining the peak of bone and muscle mass during early life, may influence the trajectory of both tissues late in life. Across the lifespan, hormonal dysfunctions (i.e., low levels of testosterone in men and estrogen in women) are also known to negatively affect both muscle and bone. Adipose tissue is a fundamental component of body composition and not only an inert body fat storage. In fact, adipose tissue is today recognized as an active endocrine organ mediating several metabolic processes and secreting a variety of adipokines and cytokines regulating systemic inflammation. As a consequence, adipose tissue abnormalities may have long-term negative effects on musculoskeletal health probably through the mediation of inflammatory processes, metabolic dysregulation, and altered insulin sensitivity.

        Excerpt: To prevent age-associated reduction in lean mass, the recommended dietary allowance of protein of 0.8-1.0 g/kg/day is insufficient-a protein allowance of 1.0-1.3 g/kg/day is advisable. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of observational studies demonstrated that low protein intake is closely associated with frailty in older adults. In addition to proteins, micronutrients-such as vitamin D, which is associated with bone metabolism, vitamins B6, C, and E, and folate that exerts antioxidant effects-were involved in frailty. However, evidence regarding the association between dietary habits and frailty, which will help to establish appropriate nutritional interventions against frailty, is still lacking. Frailty may be targeted to extend the healthy lifespan in community-dwelling older adults living at home. We hypothesized that nutritional interventions against frailty should be established, based on sex differences in dietary habits. Therefore, this cross-sectional observation study aimed to clarify the association between dietary habits and frailty diagnosed by two different methods in rural Japanese community-dwelling older adults using a self-administered dietary history questionnaire. The cross-sectional study was designed as a Frail Elderly in the Sasayama-Tamba Area (FESTA) study. The study population, comprising of individuals ≥65 years old, was recruited among community-dwelling elderly individuals in the Sasayama-Tamba area-a rural area in the Hyogo prefecture, Japan-between November 2015 and December 2017. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the institutional review board of Hyogo College of Medicine approved the FESTA study, which complies with the current laws of Japan (approval No. Rinhi 0342). The survey commenced after an oral/written explanation of the study objectives, methods, and expected outcomes was provided to participants. All participants provided written informed consent.

        Excerpt: "Frailty is defined as a multidimensional physiological syndrome, which mainly occurs in people aged above 65 years. It is connected with a significant decrease of physiological reserve caused by numerous co-morbidities, influence of stressors, and in general the failure of homeostasis. It is the result of both the processes taking place within the body and the influence of the external environment on human organism. This finally leads to losses of energy, physical and cognitive ability, and health. One of the important factors determining the emergence and manifestation of this syndrome is the reduced physiological reserve of the body (Xue, 2011). Frailty is a geriatric syndrome meeting at least three of five criteria: weakness (low grip strength), slowness (decreased walking speed), low level of physical activity, exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss (Fried et al., 2001; Clegg et al., 2013). It is caused by multisystem dysregulations, impaired homeostasis, decreased physiologic reserve, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality (Morley, 2015). Although several definitions of frailty have been proposed, there is still not a single acceptable definition of this condition. One of the first, introduced by Fried and Walston, is that it is 'physiological syndrome, characterized by a decrease in the reserves and resistance to stressors resulting from the accumulation of reduced capacity of various physiological systems, which in turn leads to susceptibility to adverse effects' (Fried and Walston, 2003). Another definition of frailty described this syndrome as a 'loss of physiological reserve, combined with endocrine disruption and dysfunction of the immune system' (Rockwood et al., 2007). Two systematic reviews of 21 studies, including 61,500 of the elderly, showed a frailty prevalence of 4.0-59.1% (Collard et al., 2012; Jha et al., 2015). Based on criteria proposed by Fried et al. (2001), it is estimated that 6.9% of the seniors' population are frail."

        The LLM should recognize that the combination of osteoporosis and sarcopenia (osteosarcopenia) requires a therapy and regimen that addresses both bone density loss and decline in muscle mass. The LLM should focus on exercises that support muscle-building, balance and reduce fracture risk as well as the risk for falls. It could recommend resistance training, moderate training with weights (walking, stair climbing) and/or training which supports overall body balance (yoga, pilates, tai chi). Initially, the exercises should be performed under supervision.
        Beside a balanced training regimen the individual could benefit from a diet rich in protein, micronutrients and minerals such as Calcium and Vitamin D and which also consists of anti-inflammatory foods (vegetables, healthy fats).
        The individual should monitor bone mineral density, muscle mass and Vitamin D, along with other important blood markers. The LLM might recommend staging sarcopenia according to one of the well-known scores (e.g. EWGSOP).

        Authors: Liaskou, Wilson, Oo
        Excerpt: "The immune system is made up of a coordinated network of cells, tissues and organs, which are able to attack nonself-exogenous pathogens and self-endogenous danger with a complex set of defence mechanisms. It responds to pathogens in two fundamental pathways: the primal strategy of 'identifying and destroying' (innate immunity) or the specific detection and targeted killing process with regulation and memory (adaptive immunity). The innate immune system is the first line of defence against initial invading organisms and environmental challenges during the initial critical hours and days of life. The overall survival of the host depends on its ability to recognise and induce the appropriate defence signals for the elimination of infectious microbes. Through anatomical barriers (skin and mucosal epithelia of the gastrointestinal, respiratory and reproductive tracts), soluble antimicrobial factors (acute phase proteins, complement and cytokines), and cellular components, the innate immune system provides protective barriers between the inside of the body and the outside world. Innate immune cells [monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells] are able to recognise pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as components of microorganisms [lipopolysaccharide (LPS), glycolipids, flagellin, lipoproteins, viral RNA and bacterial DNA] and endogenous ligands (such as heat shock proteins released by damaged or necrotic host cells) via their pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which include receptors for bacterial carbohydrates and toll-like receptors (TLRs). The TLRs and corresponding ligands, their impact on innate immune system are described in Table 1. Engagement of PAMPs with PRRs results in targeted and specific destruction of the activating organism, infected or tumour cells, by releasing cytotoxic agents or phagocytosis. Adult human liver is the largest internal organ in the body, weighing 1.2-1.5 kg."

        Excerpt: The main functions of body's immune system are to protect the host against infection from pathological microorganisms, to clear damaged tissues, and to provide constant surveillance of malignant cells that grow within the body. Additionally, the immune system develops appropriate tolerance to avoid unwanted response to healthy tissues of self or harmless foreign substances. There is considerable heterogeneity among individuals in the vigor of their immunological function, largely owing to factors such as genetics, environment, lifestyle, nutrition, and the interaction of these factors. Nutrition as a modifiable factor in impacting immune function has been studied for several decades, and the research in this field has developed into a distinguished study subject called nutritional immunology. As with other bodily systems, the immune system depends on adequate nutrients to function properly. It is well-documented that nutritional status is closely associated with immunity and host resistance to infection. There is little argument that deficiency in both macronutrients and micronutrients causes immune function impairment, which can be reversed by nutrient repletion. Nutritional deficiencies are still prevalent in less developed regions and are a main contributor to a high incidence of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. Even in developed countries where general nutritional deficiencies are rare, nutrition issues such as specific nutrient deficiencies, less ideal diet composition, and excess calorie consumption are still a challenging reality. This situation is particularly significant in the elderly population due to a variety of factors more common in this population including disability, disease, disease-associated and medicine-induced anorexia, poor food selection, and lower socio-economic status.

        Excerpt: "Potential Application of Plant-Based Functional Foods in the Development of Immune Boosters', 'annotations_paragraph': 'The immune system is one of the most complex biological systems in the body. It is a multifaceted and sophisticated network of specialized organs, cells, proteins, and chemicals, and plays an essential role in conferring protection against various pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi), and cancer cells (Carr and Maggini, 2017). It is well known that host immunity is constituted by innate (non-specific) and adaptive (specific) immunity ( Figure 1) (Orlowsky and Kraus, 2015;Nicholson, 2016). Immune system dysfunction renders an organism sensitive to pathogens, which can lead to the development of diseases, such as allergic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases (Williams et al., 2017b;Ding et al., 2018;García et al., 2020). Since immunity is fundamental to the health of the host and plays an important role in preventing diseases, increased research efforts have been engaged at improving immune function. Currently, the clinical application of immunomodulators mainly includes immune adjuvants, such as aluminum hydroxide, Freund's adjuvant, and albumen adjuvants (Yu et al., 2016;Cronkite and Strutt, 2018). However, these adjuvants have been reported to cause local stimulation, tissue damage, and carcinogenesis. Additionally, neither aluminum hydroxide nor Freund's adjuvant can induce a strong cellular immune response . Although albumen adjuvants have recently been used as the primary treatment strategy for improving the immune function of individuals, their application is limited by their high costs and side effects (Chen and Zhan, 2019). It is therefore necessary to explore natural, safer, and more effective adjuvants that can enhance immune systems function by activating immune cells and by modulating immune molecules. Plant-based functional foods are derived from natural or processed plant foods that contain known or unknown bioactive components (Kumar et al., 2018)."

        Excerpt: Immunology comprises the study of the immune system and its functional properties, including innate and adaptive responses, immunological memory, and the relationship between the immune system and disease. The current dogma states that an immune response is induced by the recognition of molecular patterns that trigger a quick response from the innate compartment, which in turn prompts the development of adaptive immunity. This mechanism has been extensively studied in the context of infection and injury, from which current understanding of the immune system has been inferred (1). Recent discoveries demonstrating a role of the immune system in physiological contexts, including interaction with bacterial microbiota (2), in pregnancy (3), metabolism (4), organ function (5), bone homeostasis (6), exercise (7), and senescence (8), suggest that functions of the immune system extend far beyond defending the host (9). Indeed, autoimmunity (10), cancer (11), degenerative diseases (12), and psychiatric diseases (13) exemplify paradoxes and loopholes in the current understanding of the immune system, indicating its theoretical basis should be updated. There is a consensus among scientists that the ability of microorganisms or microbial products to trigger inflammation and immune responses are important for immune function. This is not being questioned here. We would like to suggest that immune functions extend far beyond interaction with pathogens. Inflammation is a beneficial tissue response stimulated by tissue damage, which can be caused by physical, chemical, or biological stimuli (14). Inflammation is defined by the production of soluble mediators, in the alteration of vasculature, and in the recruitment of leukocytes, ultimately leading to the classical signs, such as heat, swelling, redness, pain, and loss-of-function (15,16).

        Excerpt: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a specialized columnar intestinal metaplasia containing goblet cells that replaces the native esophageal squamous mucosa in individuals with long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). BE is a pre-malignant condition of the esophagus that can progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) with poor prognosis. Patients with histological BE are 30-125 times more susceptible to developing EAC compared to those without BE. The neoplastic progression of BE has been extensively studied and defined as a metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. However the genetic basis of BE pathogenesis is poorly understood. Progressive genetic instability and clonal selection has been proposed as possible basis of neoplastic evolution in BE. Alterations in TP53 and P16 genes, aneuploidy and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) have been identified as characteristic early events of clonal evolution in the molecular pathogenesis of BE. Only 0.5-1% of BE patients progress to EAC annually, hence large cohorts have to be followed over several years to obtain statistically relevant data. Therefore a preclinical model of BE would facilitate longitudinal sampling to follow development and progression of neoplasia from non neoplastic epithelium. Rodent and canine BE models utilized surgical anastomosis to induce chronic reflux of gastric acid and/or duodenal contents, including bile into the esophagus, to induce metaplasia and dysplasia and EAC. Several ex-vivo and cell line models of BE enabled understanding of the possible contributory role of acid and bile to the molecular mechanism(s) of BE pathogenesis. The dynamic in-vitro model of BEC is developed from exposing naïve benign BAR-T cells to acid (pH4) and bile glycochenodeoxycolic acid (GCDA) for 5 mins a day, for about year. Induction of double strand DNA breaks after acute acid and bile acids exposure have been strongly suggested in BAR-T cells.

        Excerpt: Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide used by up to 30% of adults]. They are commonly prescribed for the suppression of gastric acid production in the management of gastrointestinal acid-related disorders which include gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and dyspepsia. They are available over the counter in many countries, including Sweden. Swedish clinical guidelines recommend short-term treatment for 8-12 weeks for most indications. Yet they can also be used as maintenance treatment for symptom control in individuals with chronic conditions such as refractory reflux disease (persistent symptoms), hypersecretory disorders (e.g. Barrett oesophagus, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) and for gastroprotection among aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) users. The maintenance use of PPIs has increased remarkably during recent years, and some studies estimate long-term acid suppression accounts for up to 50-66% of the total use. Worrisomely, a significant proportion of PPI users lack a clear indication for the treatment, and inappropriate prescriptions are observed in 25-70% of cases. Evidence suggests that PPIs are rarely de-prescribed, sometimes continued for long-time periods without proper reassessment resulting in an increase in long-term users over the years. Concern over the safety of long-term use of PPIs has grown, due to the observed associations between PPI use and serious adverse events such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, some of which are also associated with an increased risk of mortality. Furthermore, some recent studies describe increased all-cause and cause-specific mortality in PPI users.

        Excerpt: "The traditional Mediterranean diet (MD) is characterized by a high intake of plant-based food: fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and non-refined cereals. Moderate consumption of dairy products, poultry, and fish, and low intake of red meat is recommended. Olive oil, as a main source of fat, and moderate alcohol drinking (mainly in the form of red wine) are specific foods of this dietary pattern. MD in the context of the PREDIMED (Prevención con dieta Mediterránea) nutritional intervention clinical trial has been shown to be cardioprotective and to have an overall ameliorating effect on older adults' global cognition, with a lower incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Meta-analyses of clinical studies have only partially confirmed these results, mainly because the heterogeneity in design and methodologies. An interesting observation made in the PREDIMED study concerning cognition was that the increased consumption of antioxidant-rich foods in general and of polyphenols in particular was associated with better cognitive performance in elderly subjects at high cardiovascular risk. This is of relevance because MD is not only constituted by an adequate balance of nutrients, but also by a number of biologically active non-nutrient substances. Among them, phenolic compounds are major non-nutrient substances in our diet, mainly in plant-based foods (fruit, vegetables, cereals, legumes, and chocolate) and beverages (red wine, cocoa, and coffee). It is estimated that the total dietary intake of phenolic compounds is 1 g/day. Virgin olive oil (VOO) is the main source of fat in the MD and contributes considerably to the health properties attributed to this diet. Traditionally, the benefits of VOO were attributed to its high monounsaturated fatty acid content, principally oleic acid."

        Excerpt: The Mediterranean dietary pattern is as an excellent model of healthy eating. The term "Mediterranean diet" (MedDiet) was coined by Ancel Keys in the early 1960s and is based on the traditional culinary practices of rural areas of Southern Italy (where he lived), Crete, other parts of Greece, and other countries of the Mediterranean basin in the 1950s-1960s. There are some geographical differences in the traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern, but they all share the use of olive oil as the main culinary fat (1). Other elements included in the most frequently used definition of the MedDiet include high consumption of fruits and nuts (2), vegetables (3), legumes (4), fish (5), and whole grain cereals (6). Furthermore, a salient element of this definition is low consumption of red meat and processed meats (7) and moderate or low consumption of dairy products (8). Alcohol is consumed in modest amounts, mostly as red wine with meals (9). These nine features are used to operationally define the MedDiet as proposed by Trichopoulou et al., who used the sex-specific medians of the first six elements to assign 1 point for each element when it is above the sex-specific median and the other two elements (meat and dairy) are used to assign 1 point if they are below the sex-specific median; an additional point is assigned if ethanol intake is in the range of 5-25 g/d for women and 10-50 g/d for men. Other authors have used tertiles instead of dichotomizing by medians. Many meta-analyses have summarized the findings of large and well-conducted cohort studies showing the benefits of a better adherence to a MedDiet for the prevention of non-communicable disease (NCD). Among the different cohorts that have assessed associations between adherence to the MedDiet and NCD, the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) project is a large and still ongoing prospective cohort of relatively young adults at baseline that was designed to assess the effects of the MedDiet in a Mediterranean setting.

        Excerpt: Hypertension is a global public health problem as well as an important risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (Rossier et al., 2017; Mills et al., 2020). Increase in the ageing population and lifestyle risk factors consequently increases the global prevalence of hypertension. As of 2010, 1.38 billion people (31.1% of the global adult population) suffer from hypertension (Mills et al., 2016). Consistent with the trend of hypertension prevalence, the number of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular deaths increased significantly from 1990 to 2015; hypertension is responsible for 40.1 and 40.4% of deaths caused by heart disease deaths and stroke deaths, respectively (Forouzanfar et al., 2017; Furie, 2020; Mills et al., 2020). Hypertension is a complex and multifactorial disease affected by both genetic and environmental factors (Rossier et al., 2017; Mills et al., 2020). In the genome-wide association study of Ehret et al. involving 342,415 individuals, numerous single gene variants related to blood pressure control and hypertension were identified, but these specific causal genes only explained a small proportion of the systolic pressure variation between individuals (<5%; Ehret et al., 2016). Therefore, identification of new diagnosis and treatment targets based on hypertension pathogenesis is urgently needed. Gut microbiota and its metabolites play an important role in human health and diseases by affecting the body's metabolism, immunity, nervous system and endocrine homeostasis (Fenneman et al., 2020; Verhaar et al., 2020; Yoo et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021). Hypertension occurrence is often accompanied with gut microbiota imbalance, including decreased diversity, altered enterotype distribution and variation in bacterial populations (Li et al., 2017). It is mainly characterised by the increase in Klebsiella, Prevotella, Coprobacillus and Enterobacter populations and the decrease in Anaerotruncus, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, Roseburia, Blautia and Bifidobacterium populations, which reduce ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA; Li et al., 2017; Verhaar et al., 2020).

        Title: Targeting Cardiovascular Risk Factors Through Dietary Adaptations and Caloric Restriction Mimetics
        Open-Access-URL: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.758058/pdf

        Excerpt: In an effort to circumvent the complexity of counting calories and avoid the side effects associated with caloric restriction, other forms of dietary restriction with food intake limited to a daily time window, such as intermittent fasting and alternate day fasting, have been proposed. Accordingly, different lengths of eating and fasting periods have been tested, with the most common reported of 16/8 h of fasting and eating intervals, respectively. Longer fasting periods of 24 h followed by ad-libitum food intake for 24 h are also practiced and known as alternate-day fasting. Although intermittent fasting and alternate-day fasting are not as well-studied as caloric restriction, emerging evidence suggests that they are more tolerable and their side effects are less prominent than in caloric restriction and, thus, both dietary interventions could represent promising and more feasible strategies to curtail the hypercaloric pandemic in the Western societies. To this end, a study comparing the efficacy of caloric restriction and intermittent fasting (restricted to 2 days a week) in obese diabetic patients at risk of cardiovascular disease showed that both regimens reduce body weight and HbA1c levels, a measure of long-term blood glucose control. Consistently, another small observational study on obese subjects with diabetes mellitus type 2 and receiving metformin reported that shortterm intermittent fasting effectively reduces body weight and improves morning glucose levels. Interestingly, 6 out of 10 participants in this study described that intermittent fasting is highly tolerable, and reported readiness to follow intermittent fasting after study completion. Of note, intermittent fasting was capable to improve health parameters in healthy, male athletes. Specifically, intermittent fasting reduced body fat mass without worsening body fat-free mass, muscle area and strength.

        Excerpt: By contrast, the InterFast trial showed that alternate-day fasting is capable of improving cardiometabolic markers in healthy non-obese subjects, including reduced body weight, fat-to-lean ratio, and LDL-cholesterol. Furthermore, alternate-day fasting increases ketone bodies (on fasting and non-fasting days), and reduces the inflammatory marker sICAM-1, suggesting that alternate-day fasting is a viable dietary adaptation also for nonobese individuals. Importantly, this 4-week long intervention trial reported no adverse effects on immunity or bone density. In sum, a growing body of evidence indicates potential cardiovascular benefits of intermittent and alternate-day fasting. However, it is still not clear whether these nutritional regimens, wherein food intake is limited to a consistent timerestricted interval without changes in nutritional quality or quantity, confer a significantly better adherence than caloric restriction. Also, it remains elusive whether the cardiometabolic benefits of these regimens can be applied to the general healthy population or specific groups with disorders, such as obese individuals with metabolic disease. Hence, larger studies, preferably with long-term follow-up, will be required to address these open issues. Recent years have seen an increasing interest in fasting, mimicking diets and caloric restriction, which might offer a more feasible alternative to stringent forms of fasting. For example, a randomized clinical trial was designed to investigate the effects of fasting mimicking diets, which are low in carbohydrates and protein and high in unsaturated fats, on cardiovascular disease and risk factors, including aging and diabetes mellitus type 2. The authors observed that practicing low calorie fasting mimicking diet for only 5 consecutive days per month results in a reduction of body mass index (BMI), arterial blood pressure, fasting glucose, and IGF-1 levels.

        Excerpt: to improve health parameters in healthy, male athletes. Specifically, intermittent fasting reduced body fat mass without worsening body fat-free mass, muscle area and strength. These effects were associated with lower concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and higher adiponectin levels, while leptin was not found reduced after adjusting for body fat mass (29). By contrast, a recent meta-analysis concluded that the evidence supporting a positive effect of intermittent fasting on glucose remains uncertain, despite the robust body weightlowering effect (55). Interestingly, the analysis suggested that both intermittent fasting and caloric restriction equally improve cardiometabolic risk factors. Irrespectively, larger studies with long-term follow-up are necessary to clearly determine the effect of either regimen on hard cardiovascular end-points, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure as well as cardiac and allcause mortality. With regard to alternate-day fasting, a short-term trial conducted in obese adults, which showed high adherence to alternate-day fasting at least for 8 weeks, revealed manifold cardiometabolic benefits, including reduced body weight, body fat percentage, total and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides as well as systolic blood pressure (30). It is important to mention that the participants were allowed for 25% energy intake on fasting days. Interestingly, short-term alternate-day fasting effectively reduces body weight, body fat mass and waist circumference despite high-fat dietary intake on non-fasting days. However, although alternate-day fasting improves plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol in obese individuals, HDL-cholesterol, blood pressure and heart rate are not altered (33). At variance with short-term studies, a long-term trial reported low adherence to the prescribed amount of energy intake and, accordingly, a high dropout of obese, otherwise metabolically healthy adults subjected to alternate-day fasting

        It is important that the LLM identifies the individual’s slight iron deficiency (ferritin below normal, transferrin saturation and hemoglobin lower limit). Caloric restriction diets and intermittent fasting regimes could exacerbate the individual’s iron deficiency, if the individual does not consume enough iron-containing foods.
        The individual should postpone the planned interventions and should try to increase the intake of foods which contain a sufficient amount of iron. The LLM could recommend foods rich in heme iron or rich in non-heme iron combined with foods rich in Vitamin C or Vitamin C supplementation. Together with her healthcare provider the individual should consider proper iron supplementation.
        Iron deficiency can have multiple causes. Causes could be an already unbalanced diet, bleeding in GI tract, likely due to high intake of Aspirin and related drugs, heavy menstrual bleeding. 
        The LLM could provide adapted dietary plans for intermittent fasting with a focus on iron-rich foods. The individual should avoid nutrients that potentially decrease iron absorption (dairy products, tannin-rich food or drinks). Iron levels and body weight (preferably waist-hip-ratio)  should be monitored by a physician for tracking long-term improvements or worsening. If the iron levels remain low during the interventions the individual should reduce the intensity of the regimens or even stop them in order to prevent further worsening of her condition.

        Open-Access-URL: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2019.00697/pdf
        Authors: Grynkiewicz, Demchuk
        Excerpt: "The first record of fisetin as an isolate from venetian sumach (Rhus cotinus L.) dates back to 1833. A basic chemical characteristics of the compound was provided several decades later by Schmidt (1886), while its structure was elucidated and eventually confirmed by synthesis by S. Kostanecki, who in 1890s started a massive investigation of yellow plant pigments and coined new group names for their sub-categories, presently known as flavones, chromones, chalcones, etc. (Kostanecki et al., 1904). The flavonol fisetin), conventionally described as: 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroxy-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; 3,3 ′ ,4 ′ ,7-tetrahydroxyflavone; or 5-deoxyquercetin, and represented by the structural formula 1, has by now been identified as a secondary metabolite of many plants, occurring in their green parts, fruits, as well as in barks and hardwood (Panche et al., 2016; Hostetler et al., 2017; Verma, 2017; Wang et al., 2018). It was Roux, who in a series of meticulous studies conducted before the advent of modern spectral tools of structural analysis, explained the origin and stereochemistry of oligomeric tannins which contain flavon-3-olic structures closely related to fustin, fisetidinol, fisetin, and similar structures present in various African trees Paulus, 1961, 1962; Drewes and Roux, 1965) (Figure 1). Although condensed tannins used by the leather industry have retained some of their technical significance, today more attention is paid to the presence of fisetin in vegetable constituents of human diet and their role as important epigenetic factors in modulating the state of human health. Fisetin is present in strawberries, apples, persimmons, grapes, onions, kiwi, kale, etc., albeit in low concentration, up to hundreds of micrograms per 1 gram of fresh biomass. The reason for this interest stems from relatively recent observations that compound 1 is not only particularly efficient as an antioxidant agent, but also exhibits remarkable selectivity as regards influencing multiple biological processes considered crucial for biological homeostasis."

        Excerpt: Unfortunately, dasatinib is a chemotherapeutic agent with significant side effects, which considerably hinders the large-scale translatability of this senolytic strategy to ML/O adults free from clinical diseases due to safety concerns. Accordingly, we are highly interested in determining the safety and efficacy of natural senolytics for improving age-associated vascular dysfunction, as we believe that these compounds have the greatest potential for translation to healthy CV aging. An emerging candidate for natural senolytic is the flavonoid fisetin, which has been shown to exert senolytic effects in vivo and to increase lifespan and markers of healthspan in mouse models of both chronological and accelerated aging. Our early observations in old mice suggest that intermittent oral fisetin supplementation (100 mg/kg/day by oral gavage; 1 week on -2 weeks off -1 week on) is effective at increasing NO-mediated endothelial function and lowering arterial stiffness, and that these improvements occur as a result of suppressing excess cellular senescence in the vasculature. However, it remains to be determined if intermittent fisetin supplementation can reduce cellular senescence and improve vascular function in ML/O adults. Aging is the major risk factor for CVD due importantly to the development of vascular dysfunction (in particular endothelial dysfunction and large elastic artery stiffening) and increases in SBP. In this review, we discussed fundamental mechanisms of CV aging -processes that could serve as viable therapeutic targets for the prevention and/or treatment of CV dysfunction with aging to reduce the risk of CVD. We have also reviewed how particular exercise and "exercise-mimicking" strategies can improve CV function with aging, at least in part, by targeting the hallmarks of CV aging. Finally, we highlight established and emerging dietary patterns, nutraceuticals and synthetic pharmacological compounds that may serve as healthy CV aging interventions. There remain several important knowledge gaps in the field; the following represent some potential future biomedically significant directions for research related to healthy CV aging.

        Title: Fisetin Attenuated Oxidative Stress-Induced Cellular Damage in ARPE-19 Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells Through Nrf2-Mediated Activation of Heme Oxygenase-1

        Excerpt: Fisetin is a kind of bioactive flavonol, widely present in various fruits such as strawberries and apples, and is known to act as a potent free radical scavenger. However, the mechanism of action related to the antioxidant activity of this compound in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is not precisely known. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether fisetin could attenuate oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity on human RPE ARPE-19 cells. To mimic oxidative stress, ARPE-19 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and fisetin significantly inhibited H 2 O 2 -induced loss of cell viability and increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Fisetin also markedly attenuated DNA damage and apoptosis in H 2 O 2 -treated ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction in H 2 O 2 -treated cells was alleviated in the presence of fisetin as indicated by preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential, increase of Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio, and suppression of cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm. In addition, fisetin enhanced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), which was associated with increased expression and activity of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). However, the HO-1 inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin, significantly reversed the protective effect of fisetin against H 2 O 2 -mediated ARPE-19 cell injury. Therefore, our results suggest that Nrf2-mediated activation of antioxidant enzyme HO-1 may play an important role in the ROS scavenging activity of fisetin in RPE cells, contributing to the amelioration of oxidative stress-induced ocular disorders. Oxidative stress-induced retinal disorders are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of irreversible vision lossrelated diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy and age-related retinal degeneration (AMD) (Chichagova et al., 2018; Léveillard et al., 2019).

        Excerpt: Fisetin has been described to have many beneficial health effects, like memory enhancement. It was found to possess anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of the activation of NF-B and it has been shown previously that fisetin inhibited PARP-1 in pulmonary epithelial cells. At a concentration of 1 M, fisetin caused a mild inhibition of PARP-1 activity when cells were exposed to H 2 O 2 . Chronic treatment of HF cells with fisetin resulted in shorter telomeres compared to control cells. In cells cultured in the presence of both fisetin and t-BHP average telomere length was not significantly different compared to that of control cells. This finding appeared to support our hypothesis of the involvement of PARP-1 activity in telomere stability. A recent study by Sengupta et al. showed fisetin to be a promising ligand for the formation of a four-stranded structure known as a G-quadruplex. Formation of quadruplexes has been shown to decrease the activity of telomerase, but it also inhibits the ALT mechanism. Since this mechanism might play a role in our model, it is possible that quadruplex formation by fisetin under normal situations causes a faster rate of telomere shortening due to impairment of ALT. G-quadruplex formation is beneficial in anti cancer therapy, as it impedes telomere elongation, a mechanism most tumor cells use for unlimited proliferation. Minocycline, also known as minocycline hydrochloride, is a member of the broad spectrum tetracyclines antibiotics. It is primarily used to treat acne and other skin infections and exerts anti-inflammatory effects that are completely separate from its antimicrobial actions. We showed that nanomolar concentrations of minocycline significantly inhibited PARP-1 activity, as was previously reported by Alano et al.. Culturing of cells in the presence of 100 nM minocycline resulted in shorter average telomere length as compared to control cells.

        Title: Short-term protein restriction at advanced age stimulates FGF21 signalling, energy expenditure and browning of white adipose tissue
        Open-Access-URL: https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/febs.15604

        Excerpt: Dietary protein restriction has been demonstrated to improve metabolic health under various conditions. However, the relevance of ageing and agerelated decline in metabolic flexibility on the effects of dietary protein restriction has not been addressed. Therefore, we investigated the effect of short-term dietary protein restriction on metabolic health in young and aged mice. Young adult (3 months old) and aged (18 months old) C57Bl/ 6J mice were subjected to a 3-month dietary protein restriction. Outcome parameters included fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels, muscle strength, glucose tolerance, energy expenditure (EE) and transcriptomics of brown and white adipose tissue (WAT). Here, we report that a low-protein diet had beneficial effects in aged mice by reducing some aspects of age-related metabolic decline. These effects were characterized by increased plasma levels of FGF21, browning of subcutaneous WAT, increased body temperature and EE, while no changes were observed in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, the low-protein diet used in this study was well-tolerated in aged mice indicated by the absence of adverse effects on body weight, locomotor activity and muscle performance. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a short-term reduction in dietary protein intake can impact age-related metabolic health alongside increased FGF21 signalling, without negatively affecting muscle function. These findings highlight the potential of protein restriction as a strategy to induce EE and browning of WAT in aged individuals. Ageing and age-associated changes in lifestyle are known to affect a wide range of metabolic processes. Ageing itself is one of the main risk factors for the development of chronic metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease and cancer. With the worldwide increase in life expectancy and median lifespan over the last few decades, understanding the mechanisms by which ageing affects metabolic processes has become an increasingly important research focus.

        Authors: Waters, Baumgartner, Garry, Vellas
        Excerpt: Declining testosterone levels may account for decreasing food intake to a greater extent in men than in women. Thus, although poor overall nutritional intake may play a role in sarcopenia, low protein intake appears to be a significant problem for older adults and may be a potential target for an intervention strategy. Daily intake of 1.2-1.5 g/kg of protein has been reported to prevent sarcopenia, whereas the current recommended daily dietary protein intake requirement for adults is 0.8 g/kg/d. Preliminary data from a recent randomized controlled trial indicate that it is more important to ingest a sufficient amount of high-quality protein (25-30 g) with each meal rather than 1 large bolus, because greater than 30 g in a single meal may not further stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Furthermore, Paddon-Jones and Rasmussen reported that aging does not inevitably reduce the anabolic response to a high-quality protein meal, rather it is the presence of carbohydrates that blunts this response due to the effects of insulin resistance on muscle protein synthesis. These data would suggest that highquality protein should be consumed in smaller quantities, but not together with carbohydrates. These recommendations may not be easy to achieve. Volpi et al have conducted a number of experiments investigating muscle protein synthesis and breakdown, and amino acid transport in young and elderly subjects. In 2003, they assessed whether nonessential amino acids are required in a nutritional supplement to stimulate muscle protein anabolism in the elderly and reported that essential amino acids are primarily responsible for the amino acid stimulation of muscle protein anabolism in healthy elderly adults. There is a general agreement that the essential amino acid leucine increases protein anabolism and decreases protein breakdown. Leucine-rich food sources include legumes such as soybeans and cowpea, and animal products such as beef and fish.

        Excerpt: To prevent age-associated reduction in lean mass, the recommended dietary allowance of protein of 0.8-1.0 g/kg/day is insufficient-a protein allowance of 1.0-1.3 g/kg/day is advisable. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of observational studies demonstrated that low protein intake is closely associated with frailty in older adults. In addition to proteins, micronutrients-such as vitamin D, which is associated with bone metabolism, vitamins B6, C, and E, and folate that exerts antioxidant effects-were involved in frailty. However, evidence regarding the association between dietary habits and frailty, which will help to establish appropriate nutritional interventions against frailty, is still lacking. Frailty may be targeted to extend the healthy lifespan in community-dwelling older adults living at home. We hypothesized that nutritional interventions against frailty should be established, based on sex differences in dietary habits. Therefore, this cross-sectional observation study aimed to clarify the association between dietary habits and frailty diagnosed by two different methods in rural Japanese community-dwelling older adults using a self-administered dietary history questionnaire. The cross-sectional study was designed as a Frail Elderly in the Sasayama-Tamba Area (FESTA) study. The study population, comprising of individuals ≥65 years old, was recruited among community-dwelling elderly individuals in the Sasayama-Tamba area-a rural area in the Hyogo prefecture, Japan-between November 2015 and December 2017. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the institutional review board of Hyogo College of Medicine approved the FESTA study, which complies with the current laws of Japan (approval No. Rinhi 0342). The survey commenced after an oral/written explanation of the study objectives, methods, and expected outcomes was provided to participants. All participants provided written informed consent.

        Authors: Uchmanowicz, Nessler, Gobbens, Gackowski, Kurpas, Straburzynska-Migaj, Kałuzna-Oleksy, Jankowska
        Excerpt: "Frailty is defined as a multidimensional physiological syndrome, which mainly occurs in people aged above 65 years. It is connected with a significant decrease of physiological reserve caused by numerous co-morbidities, influence of stressors, and in general the failure of homeostasis. It is the result of both the processes taking place within the body and the influence of the external environment on human organism. This finally leads to losses of energy, physical and cognitive ability, and health. One of the important factors determining the emergence and manifestation of this syndrome is the reduced physiological reserve of the body (Xue, 2011). Frailty is a geriatric syndrome meeting at least three of five criteria: weakness (low grip strength), slowness (decreased walking speed), low level of physical activity, exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss (Fried et al., 2001; Clegg et al., 2013). It is caused by multisystem dysregulations, impaired homeostasis, decreased physiologic reserve, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality (Morley, 2015). Although several definitions of frailty have been proposed, there is still not a single acceptable definition of this condition. One of the first, introduced by Fried and Walston, is that it is 'physiological syndrome, characterized by a decrease in the reserves and resistance to stressors resulting from the accumulation of reduced capacity of various physiological systems, which in turn leads to susceptibility to adverse effects' (Fried and Walston, 2003). Another definition of frailty described this syndrome as a 'loss of physiological reserve, combined with endocrine disruption and dysfunction of the immune system' (Rockwood et al., 2007). Two systematic reviews of 21 studies, including 61,500 of the elderly, showed a frailty prevalence of 4.0-59.1% (Collard et al., 2012; Jha et al., 2015). Based on criteria proposed by Fried et al. (2001), it is estimated that 6.9% of the seniors' population are frail."

      summary: |-
        While protein restriction is believed to exert positive effects in younger individuals (and animal models) it is considered contraindicated in elderly comorbid individuals (here: sarcopenia, hypertension, osteoporosis). Thus, a restriction in daily protein intake could cause an exacerbation of the individual’s already low baseline muscle mass and bone mineral density, thereby increasing the risk of a fulminant osteoporosis and risk and falls, respectively. 
        The individual should lay his focus on consuming a sufficient amount of protein to maintain muscle mass and to prevent further decline in muscle mass and bone health. The LLM could suggest sources of protein such as fish, eggs, dairy products, … The LLM may suggest protein primarily from plant sources.
        Instead of trying to improve health by protein restriction the individual should attempt moderate exercise regimens appropriate for building and maintaining muscle and bone mass. Regular function assessments, monitoring for muscle and bone health and long-term monitoring of inflammatory markers could be an option for tracking the individual’s condition in the long-term.

        Excerpt: (-)-Epicatechin (EC) is one of the most abundant naturally occurring polyphenol compounds found in the human diet and is commonly found in plants as a secondary metabolite. It is the primary form of flavan-3-alcohol, which commonly exists in cocoa, tea, apple and catechus. As shown in Figure 1, the molecular structure of EC is composed of two aromatic rings and one oxygen-containing heterocyclic ring. This stereochemical configuration makes it easier to be absorbed orally compared with other monomeric forms in the catechin category. Furthermore, the presence of epigallate and a hydroxyl group, as well as the number and position of its double bonds, give it a unique pharmacological profile. It has been shown that EC has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and is considered to be one of the best naturally occurring compounds for the treatment and prevention of various related diseases. EC itself and EC-rich foods have been demonstrated to have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, the prevention of metabolic disorders, the enhancement of muscle strength and the maintenance of nerve function in a number of clinical trials. It has also been used to treat chronic inflammation independently and applied as an adjuvant therapy in combination with dexamethasone or any other drugs. However, so far, no studies have been performed about the effect of EC on the improvement of reproductive function and protection of the ovary, as current research has mainly focused its effects on other diseases. Network pharmacology, based on the theory of systems biology and high-throughput research, can be used to construct a 'component-target-pathway' network and demonstrate effects on a particular disease by a specific drug systematically and comprehensively.

        Excerpt: The modulation of longevity genes and aging-associated signaling pathways using chemicals is one of the potential ways to increase the human lifespan. Recently, more attention was given to natural compounds as they are considered safer for use (Carretero et al., 2015). The geroprotective effects of a variety of phytochemicals including flavonoids are already revealed (Leonov et al., 2015). At the same time, the most of age-related pathologies and aging process are associated with chronic inflammation (Franceschi and Campisi, 2014). Therefore, inhibition of this process using anti-inflammatory drugs can be an effective geroprotective method. Flavonoids is a class of polyphenolic natural chemicals with revealed antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties (Zern and Fernandez, 2005; Seelinger et al., 2008; Vauzour et al., 2008; Ruijters et al., 2013; Vinayagam and Xu, 2015). However, their ability to demonstrate positive effects is highly dependent on applied concentrations. In high concentrations, even toxic effects can be observed. For example, flavonoid (−)-epigallocatechin 3gallate in low concentrations (1-10 µM) protects neuronal cells against oxidative damage (Levites et al., 2002). In contrast, pro-oxidant properties of the compound were observed, when higher concentrations were used (10-50 µM). Quercetin and (-)-epicatechin are among the most well-studied flavonoids. They are abundant in the human diet (Arts et al., 2000a,b; Boots et al., 2008). Quercetin belongs to a subclass of flavonols and is mainly consumed by humans with onions and tea (Hertog et al., 1993). (-)-epicatechin belongs to flavanols and can be mainly found in cocoa and green tea (Shay et al., 2015). The health-benefiting properties of quercetin and (-)-epicatechin are determined by their antioxidant and/or non-antioxidant activity.

        Excerpt: (+)-Catechin, (-)-Epicatechin, (-)-Epicatechin-3-gallate, gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate. The ingested flavonoids, such as phytonutrients, indirectly provide energy and key elements in humans with healthpromoting effects, where the gut microbiota serves a pivotal role. The gut microbiota comprises of microorganisms residing in the human gastrointestinal tract with the total number of more than 100 trillion cells. Its composition varies along the digestive tract and remains plastic according to the lifestyle as well as nutritional status of host throughout the life. The gut microbiota defines the gastrointestinal functional ecology by absorption, digestion, metabolism, and excretion of flavonoids, leading to the regulation of host immune response and behavior with longterm effects. Moreover, the changes in the composition of gut microbiota also introduce perturbation to bioavailability and biological effect of flavonoids. Consequently, the flavonoids regulate gut microbiota with varying levels of efficacy, including the stimulation of commensal and beneficial microbiota or the inhibition of the colonization of enteric pathogens. It is therefore crucial to decipher the reciprocal correlation between flavonoids and gut microbiota. Natural flavonoids can regulate the gut microbiota from the aspects of type and amount and ameliorate dysbiosis or maintain intestinal homeostasis, thereby maintaining the host gut health. Besides, the different types of flavonoids exhibit different efficacy in boosting or suppressing the growth of gut microbiota. Recent evidence suggests that the flavonoids from tart cherries substantially increase the specific Bacteroides and Collinsella. Furthermore, an in vivo study showed that gut microbiota composition changed with the consumption of tart cherries.

        Excerpt: epicatechin could be found in high concentrations in apples (Malus domestica), blackberries, broad beans (Vicia faba), cherries (Prunus cerasus), black grapes, pears (Pyrus spp.), raspberries (Rubus spp.), and chocolate (Theobroma cacao). Catechins showed in vitro protection against degenerative diseases and a strong inverse relationship between the intake of catechins and risk of mortality by cardiovascular heart diseases. It has been reported that catechins have antimicrobic activity (gram-positive more than gram-negative) and inhibit carcinogenesis of the skin, lung, esophagus, stomach, liver, small intestine, colon, bladder, prostate, and mammary glands. EGCG has been described to have many potential targets for action against carcinogens and among them also sphingolipids. Brizuela et al. reported, for the first time, that green tea polyphenols (EGCG and polyphenon E, PPE) inhibit SphK1 activity, via a novel ERK/PLD-dependent mechanism in prostate cancer cells (C4-2B hormone-responsive and PC-3 hormone-refractory). The treatment with ECGC and PPE in both PC-3 and C4-2B cell lineages showed a remarkable inhibition of cell growth by altering the sphingolipid balance correlated with SphK1 inhibition and increment of pro-apoptotic Cer. The mechanisms underlying SphK1 inhibition by green tea extract are dependent on the down-regulation of the ERK1/2 and consequently with PLD/PA signaling pathway. In vivo studies, confirmed the data obtained in vitro, suggesting that animals with SphK1 overexpressing PC-3 cells implanted in a subcutaneous district develop larger tumors and resistance to green tea due to disruption of sphingolipid equilibrium. In conjunction, EGCG and PPE diet is also associated with a significant metastasis reduction in the orthotopic PC-3 model. Preventive approaches using catechins have been shown to inhibit other cancers as the colon one.

The mentioned fatigue could also be a sign for an underlying disease, whether physiological or psychological.
        The LLM should provide an overview of the scientific evidence and research proposing Epicatechin as an “exercise mimetic” and valuable supplements in terms of longevity medicine (cardiovascular health, muscle health, cognitive health). The LLM could propose published safe dosage regimens and recommend monitoring for possible side-effects.
        The LLM should highlight that the supplementation of Epicatechin (or any other exercise mimetic) alone won’t fully reduce or prevent causes of a sedentary lifestyle, although the interaction between exercise and geroprotection needs to be elucidated. The individual should include regular exercise (aerobic training, moderate intensity or HIIT training, …) and should focus on a healthy and balanced diet with natural sources of Epicatechin and anti-inflammatory nutrients.
        If needed and/or wished the individual could consider regular monitoring of metabolic, cardiovascular markers or other biomarkers.
