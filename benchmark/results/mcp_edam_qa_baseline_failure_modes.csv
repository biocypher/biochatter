- It performs peak detection (also called peak picking/centroiding) on mass spectrometry spectra: identifying m/z positions and their corresponding signal intensities that represent true analyte peaks rather than noise.

What that means (expanded)
- Input: one or more MS spectra (arrays of m/z values and intensities, often profile data).
- Operation: noise/background removal and smoothing (optional), detection of local maxima that meet criteria (intensity threshold, signal‑to‑noise ratio, minimum width), and conversion of profile peaks into discrete peak descriptors (centroiding).
- Output: a list of detected peaks with at least m/z and intensity, often also peak width, retention time (for LC‑MS), S/N, and optionally isotope/deconvolution annotations.

Common algorithms and parameters
- Simple local maxima with intensity or S/N threshold.
- Smoothing + derivative-based zero crossings.
- Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for multi‑scale peak picking.
- Savitzky–Golay smoothing and centroiding.
- Parameters: noise threshold or S/N cutoff, minimum/maximum peak width, baseline subtraction method, deisotoping settings.

- Expression data — binary sparse or dense matrix (recommended: HDF5-backed AnnData .h5ad, Loom .loom, NumPy .npz, or R .rds).
- Feature (gene/peak/cell) tables — binary columnar or relational file (recommended: Parquet .parquet, Feather .feather, or HDF5 datasets).
- Alignment results — standard binary aligner formats (BAM .bam or CRAM .cram) with their index files (.bai or .crai).

Details and recommended conventions

1) Expression data
- Typical contents: matrix of counts/normalized values (cells × features), optionally additional layers (raw counts, normalized, scaled), cell and feature metadata.
- Recommended binary formats:
  - AnnData HDF5-backed (.h5ad) — widely used for single‑cell workflows; stores X, obs, var, layers, uns; efficient chunking/compression.
  - Loom (.loom) — HDF5-based, good for matrix + row/column attributes.
  - NumPy .npz — simple binary arrays (good for small/medium datasets).
  - R serialized (.rds/.rdata) — convenient for R workflows (Seurat/SingleCellExperiment objects).
- Implementation notes: store sparse matrices (CSR/CSC) where possible, use float32 for expression values to save space, and include metadata attributes (version, normalization method, provenance). Provide a small JSON or YAML metadata file if the binary container is not self-describing.

2) Feature tables (genes, peaks, cell metadata)
- Typical contents: feature IDs, names, genomic coordinates (for peaks), annotations, quality metrics; cell metadata: sample, batch, cell type labels, QC metrics.
- Recommended binary formats:
  - Parquet (.parquet) or Feather (.feather) — columnar, compressed, fast for analytics.
  - HDF5 group/datasets — keep feature tables inside the same HDF5/AnnData file to keep data and annotations together.
  - SQLite (.db) — if you want relational queries.
- Implementation notes: include clear column types, controlled vocabularies where applicable, and a README/JSON describing columns.

3) Alignment results
- Typical contents: per-read alignments, flags, mapping quality, CIGAR strings, optional tags (e.g., cell barcode, UMI).
- Standard binary formats:
  - BAM (.bam) — binary equivalent of SAM, widely supported.
  - CRAM (.cram) — compressed, smaller on disk but needs reference for decompression.
  - Index files: .bai (for BAM) or .crai (for CRAM) — required for random access.
- Implementation notes: keep files coordinate-sorted for downstream tools; include read groups and sample metadata in the header; provide MD5 checksums and, for CRAM, document the reference sequence used.

Auxiliary files and best practices
- Always provide small human-readable metadata (JSON/YAML/TSV) describing file contents, schema, software versions, and provenance.
- Provide checksums (.md5) and, where relevant, index files (.bai/.crai).
- Favor compression and chunking for large HDF5/Parquet files; prefer sparse encodings for count matrices.
- Use stable data types (float32/int32) and document any scaling or normalization applied.

How to read these files (common tools/libraries)
- Expression HDF5/AnnData: Python — anndata, h5py; R —zellkonverter, SeuratDisk.
- Loom: loompy (Python), Seurat/loomR (R).
- Parquet/Feather: pyarrow / pandas (Python), arrow (R).
- NumPy .npz: numpy.load()

gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07,mcp_edam_dev:three_term_operations_9,"Briefly — this tool performs three linked steps in LC/GC–MS data processing. For each I’ll state the purpose, typical inputs/outputs, common algorithms/approaches, important tunable parameters, and practical tips.

1) Peak detection (peak picking)
- Purpose: find chromatographic peaks (ions) in each raw run and measure their properties (m/z, retention time, intensity, peak shape).
- Input: raw spectra or chromatograms (centroided or profile; vendor files or mzML).
- Output: list of peaks per sample with m/z, RT, intensity/area, peak boundaries, S/N.
- Common algorithms: centroiding (if needed) + chromatographic peak picking (e.g., continuous wavelet transform, centWave, matched filtering, local maxima with thresholding).
- Key parameters: noise / SNR threshold, ppm or m/z tolerance, min/max peak width (seconds), baseline and smoothing settings, minimum intensity.
- Tips/pitfalls: choose min/max peak width to match chromatography; centroid vs profile affects sensitivity; too-low thresholds create many false peaks, too-high lose low-abundance features.

2) Retention-time correction (alignment)
- Purpose: correct RT drift between runs so the same analyte lines up across samples.
- Input: detected peaks (m/z+RT) or full chromatograms from multiple samples.
- Output: corrected RTs or mapping functions for each sample; aligned peak lists.
- Common approaches: pairwise or global alignment using landmark matching (shared peaks), warping algorithms (dynamic time warping / obiwarp), LOESS/local regression, linear shift or parametric models.
- Key parameters: choice of reference/sample, RT tolerance window, smoothing for warping, minimum number of landmarks, maximum allowed shift.
- Tips/pitfalls: use a representative reference or compute a consensus; inspect diagnostic plots (RT difference vs reference) to spot overfitting; alignment can fail with few shared features or heavy sample heterogeneity.

3) Feature extraction (grouping and deconvolution)
- Purpose: combine corresponding peaks from different samples into features (rows in a feature table), annotate isotopes/adducts, and produce the matrix for downstream stats.
- Input: peak lists with corrected RTs (and m/z).
- Output: feature table (feature ID, representative m/z, RT, intensities across samples, metadata such as isotope/adduct annotations, peak counts).
- Common steps/algorithms: m/z and RT based grouping (nearest-neighbor clustering), retention time window and ppm tolerance, adduct/isotope annotation (mass differences), deisotoping and charge deconvolution, gap filling (re-extract signal for missing entries).
- Key parameters: m/z tolerance (ppm or Da), RT tolerance, minimum fraction of samples present, isotope/adduct rules.
- Tips/pitfalls: perform gap filling carefully (can introduce noise); annotate adducts to avoid counting the same compound multiple times; validate with extracted ion chromatograms for critical features.

How they fit together
- Peak detection feeds the RT-correction step (landmarks), and corrected peaks are grouped into features. Parameters interact (e.g., peak width affects how many landmarks exist for alignment), so tuning and iterative inspection are usual. Final outputs typically are a feature table (m/z, RT, intensities), feature chromatograms, and optional annotation files for isotopes/adducts.

Quality checks to run
- Inspect sample chromatograms and a few example extracted ion chromatograms (EICs).
- Plot RT shift before/after alignment.
- Check distributions of feature intensities and missingness, and verify a few high/low-abundance features manually.
- Run blank subtraction and sample QC (pooled QC reproducibility).

- Accepted formats
  - mzML (.mzML) and gzipped mzML (.mzML.gz).
  - mzML must follow the PSI mzML standard (common mzML files produced by ProteoWizard msConvert are fine).
  - Vendor proprietary raw formats are not accepted unless converted to mzML first.

- Data types inside the mzML
  - MS1 and MSn (MS2, MS3, etc.) spectra.
  - Positive or negative ionization mode.
  - Profile or centroided spectra (both accepted, but centroided is recommended for many downstream steps because it is faster and often cleaner).
  - Indexed mzML (with an indexListOffset) is supported and improves random access performance.
  - Chromatogram data (TIC/XIC) if present can be used.

- Required fields / minimal content
  - spectrum entries containing m/z and intensity arrays.
  - retention time (scan start time) for each spectrum.
  - ms level (1, 2, ...).
  - for MSn: precursor information (precursor m/z, charge where available).

- Recommendations
  - Convert vendor files with ProteoWizard msConvert (choose mzML, include indexing).
  - If you have very large files, consider centroiding or splitting into smaller runs to improve speed/memory use.
  - Make sure precursor charge and retention times are present for MS2-based analyses.

gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07,mcp_edam_dev:two_term_operations_6,"Short answer: it finds chromatographic or spectral peaks in each run (peak detection/picking), extracts their properties (RT, intensity/area, width, S/N, m/z if applicable), and then brings peaks from different runs into register by correcting/warping retention times and matching corresponding features across samples (retention-time alignment).  

More detail — typical operations performed

- Preprocessing
  - Baseline correction/subtraction to remove low-frequency background.
  - Noise reduction / smoothing (e.g., moving average, Savitzky–Golay) to make peak shapes clearer.
  - Optional mass filtering or chromatogram extraction (for LC–MS: extract ion chromatograms, for GC–MS: total ion chromatogram).

- Peak detection (peak picking)
  - Detection of local maxima or peak-shaped features (thresholding, wavelet transform, matched filtering).
  - Peak characterization: retention time (RT) of apex, start/end RT, peak width, peak height, integrated area, signal-to-noise ratio, centroid m/z if applicable.
  - Deconvolution / peak splitting for overlapping peaks (Gaussian fitting, EM, or wavelet-based deconvolution).
  - Filtering: remove peaks below intensity/SNR, outside expected width ranges, or failing shape criteria.

- Peak quantification
  - Integration of peak area (and/or height), baseline-corrected area.
  - Optionally normalize intensities (total ion current, internal standard, sample amount).

- Retention-time alignment
  - Determine mapping between RT scales of runs (reference-based or pairwise).
  - Methods include linear correction, LOESS/LOWESS regression, dynamic time warping (DTW), correlation-optimized warping (COW), parametric time-warping, or obiwarp-like algorithms.
  - Use of anchors: internal standards or landmark peaks to build alignment model.
  - Global or local warping to correct systematic shifts and non-linear RT deviations.

- Feature matching and grouping across samples
  - Match peaks across aligned runs using RT tolerance and (for LC–MS) m/z tolerance.
  - Group corresponding peaks into features/consensus peaks (feature table).
  - Gap filling: search for missing peaks at expected RT/m/z positions and integrate low-SNR signals.

- Quality control & output
  - QC metrics (alignment error, number of matched peaks, retention time residuals).
  - Visualization: chromatogram overlays, alignment maps, peak detection overlays.
  - Export: peak lists, feature tables (samples × features), chromatograms, integrated areas, and metadata.

Typical inputs & outputs
- Input: chromatograms or LC/GC-MS data files (raw or centroided), optional reference run or standards list.
- Output: list/table of detected peaks per run (RT, area, height, width, S/N, m/z), aligned feature table across runs, QC metrics/plots.

User knobs and parameters (commonly tuned)
- Signal-to-noise threshold, minimum peak height/area.
- Minimum/maximum peak width.
- Smoothing window size or wavelet scales.
- RT tolerance and m/z tolerance for matching.
- Choice of alignment method and rigidity (how much warping allowed).
- Reference run or use of internal standards for alignment.

Caveats / best practices
- Tune thresholds to avoid false positives/negatives; use known standards to validate.
- For LC–MS include m/z matching to reduce incorrect matches in complex samples.
- Strong non-linear RT shifts may require flexible warping methods and good anchors.
- Check QC plots to ensure alignment didn’t overfit (distort peak shapes or create false matches).

- Two primary outputs: 1) expression data (matrix of feature × sample/cell counts or values) and 2) a feature table (metadata for each feature/gene/OTU/peak).

More detail — what each contains and common formats

1) Expression data
- What it is: a matrix of measurements for every feature across every sample/cell (counts, intensities, abundances, etc.).
- Typical contents:
  - Rows: feature IDs (gene IDs, transcript IDs, OTU/ASV IDs, peak IDs)
  - Columns: sample or cell IDs (barcodes, sample names)
  - Values: raw counts (e.g., UMI counts), normalized counts (CPM/TPM/RPKM), log-transformed values, or other quantitative measures
- Common file formats:
  - Text: CSV / TSV (dense)

2) Feature table (feature metadata / annotation)
- What it is: one row per feature with descriptive fields used for interpretation and filtering.
- Typical columns:
  - feature_id (matching expression matrix rows)
  - feature_name / gene_symbol

Most common accepted formats
- mzML: Open, vendor-agnostic standard. Contains MS1/MS2 spectra, m/z, intensity, retention time, charge, etc.
- mzXML: Older open standard, similar content to mzML.
- mgf: Peak-list format for MS/MS data (useful for peptide identifications).
- mz5: A binary index format for large datasets (less common, but supported by some tools).

Vendor raw formats (only if supported by the tool)
- Thermo .raw
- Bruker .d
- Agilent .d
- Waters .raw
Note: Many tools require conversion from these raw formats to mzML/mgf first, unless they have native readers.

Plain text / CSV formats (less common for raw LC-MS data, but sometimes used for posts or summaries)
- Columns might include: file/scan, retention time (rt), m/z, intensity, charge, precursor m/z, etc.
- Example: a list of peaks as separate rows with columns like rt, mz, intensity.

How to prepare data
- For full LC-MS data: convert to mzML or mzXML (recommended) using ProteoWizard’s msConvert or similar.
- For MS/MS peak lists: mgf is widely accepted for spectral library searches.
- If you only have processed data (feature lists): a simple tab-delimited or CSV with columns like m/z, rt, and intensity can be sufficient for some tools.

Data content you’ll typically need
- m/z values and corresponding intensities
- Retention time (optional but common)
- Scan or spectrum identifiers
- For MS/MS data: fragment m/z and intensities, precursor information (m/z, charge, precursor scan)

gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,mcp_edam_dev:single_term_operation_4,"Short answer: It identifies and characterizes peaks in mass spectrometry data. In other words, it “picks” the signals that correspond to ions from the noisy spectrum and records their properties.

What it does
- Scans a spectrum (m/z vs. intensity) to find local maxima that stand out from the noise.
- Distinguishes real peaks from background noise through smoothing, baseline subtraction, and thresholding.
- Estimates peak parameters, such as:
  - m/z position (the centroid or apex of the peak)
  - peak height (intensity at the apex)
  - peak area or integrating intensity across the peak
  - peak width and shape (sometimes Gaussian/Voigt fitting is used)
- Often assigns or helps infer additional information in advanced workflows, such as charge state and isotopic pattern for MS data, or retention time in LC-MS.

Input and output
- Input: a spectrum or series of spectra (mass/charge vs intensity; may be profile or centroided data).
- Output: a list of detected peaks with attributes like m/z, intensity, area, possible retention time, and quality metrics (e.g., signal-to-noise).

Typical parameters
- Noise threshold or minimum peak height
- Baseline subtraction method and sensitivity
- Smoothing level or filter type
- Mass tolerance (for grouping nearby signals)
- Minimum width or sharpness
- Whether to perform peak fitting (Gaussian/Voigt) for better m/z and area estimates

Notes and caveats
- Can be performed on individual spectra or across chromatograms (LC-MS) to find peaks over time.
- Centroiding vs. profile data: centroiding reduces data to peak centers; profile retains full shape.
- Accurate peak picking is crucial for reliable identification and quantification; poor settings can merge peaks or create false positives.
