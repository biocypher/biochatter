Parameters interact (e.g., peak width affects how many landmarks exist for alignment), so tuning and iterative inspection are usual. Final outputs typically are a feature table (m/z, RT, intensities), feature chromatograms, and optional annotation files for isotopes/adducts.\n\nQuality checks to run\n- Inspect sample chromatograms and a few example extracted ion chromatograms (EICs).\n- Plot RT shift before/after alignment.\n- Check distributions of feature intensities and missingness, and verify a few high/low-abundance features manually.\n- Run blank subtraction and sample QC (pooled QC reproducibility).\n\nIf you want, I can: suggest default parameter ranges for a particular instrument/column, explain one algorithm in more detail (e.g., centWave or obiwarp), or give an example workflow for your data.
