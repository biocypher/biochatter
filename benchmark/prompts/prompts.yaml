        <NOTE>
        Being correct means generating outputs that are *factual* and supported by empirical evidence, particularly adhering to the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM). 
        It includes reproducibility, adherence to approved scientific methods of induction and deduction, and the ability to generalize knowledge in an evidence-based manner while aligning 
        with current scientific standards.

        You will receive instructions on how to proceed with the evaluation and assessment:
          - First, you receive the user’s question, including his/her biomarker profile (<USER DATA>).
          - Next, you receive an expert commentary about what is expected from the LLM's response to the question and you receive a keyword list with the most important keywords related to the user's question and profile (<EXPERT INPUT>).
          - You begin gathering information about this data from your own knowledge (<DATA COLLECTION>).
          - You use the provided information and the information you gathered to summarize the user’s question and profile (<USER SUMMARY>).
          - You receive the recommendation text prepared by the other LLM in response to the question (<RESPONSE>).
          - You receive the expert-based ground truth for the response to the question (<GROUND TRUTH>) denoted as either "yes" or "no".
          - The analysis is correct if the final answer of the LLM ("Final answer: ..." in <PROVIDED ANALYSIS>) == <GROUND TRUTH> and follows <DATA COLLECTION>, <USER SUMMARY>.  
          - The analysis is not correct if the final answer of the LLM ("Final answer: ..." in <PROVIDED ANALYSIS>) != <GROUND TRUTH> and does not follow <DATA COLLECTION>, <USER SUMMARY>. 

          To repeat: Evaluate the <RESPONSE> using the ground truth (<GROUND TRUTH>). 
          **ONLY return "correct" or "not correct" and not the whole answer.**

      prompt: |-
        <NOTE>
        Being comprehensive means addressing and aggregating *all* relevant aspects of a query and its associated topic. In healthcare and related fields, this involves drawing connections across numerous data points 
        while balancing the depth of information with the needs and comprehension levels of the user as the intended audience.

    usefulness:

      prompt: |-
        <NOTE>
          Being useful means to condense all *relevant* aspects of a topic into statements tailored to the user, that is, to directly address his/her intention and context. 
          A useful statement is tailored to the user's needs, aligning with his/her cognitive context without requiring significant effort for integration. 
          In general healthcare, personalised medicine, or medical intervention analysis, this involves balancing usefulness with the appropriate level of comprehensiveness.

        <NOTE>
          Interpretability refers to easy *understanding*, that is, how quickly and effectively a text can be connected to a user's cognitive context, based on his/her background knowledge. 
          Explainability builds upon interpretability by providing additional reasoning and evidence, such as summaries of data sources or supporting rationales, 
          to enhance the understanding of e.g. the decisions behind the generated output.
