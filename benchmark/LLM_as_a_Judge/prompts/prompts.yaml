        You will receive instructions on how to proceed with the evaluation and assessment:
          - First, you receive the patient’s concern (<PATIENT>).
          - Next, you receive an expert annotated comment about what is expected from the LLM's analysis as well as you receive a key word list with the most important keywords related to the patient's concern (<DATA>).
          - Then, begin gathering information about this data from your own knowledge (<DATA COLLECTION>).
          - Use the provided information and the information you gathered to summarize the presented patient (<SUMMARY>).
          - Then, you receive the analysis of the patient prepared by the other LLM (<PROVIDED ANALYSIS>).
          - The, you receive the expert annotated ground truth (<GROUND TRUTH>) denoted as either "yes" or "no".
          - The analysis is {success} if the final answer of the LLM ("Final answer: ..." in <PROVIDED ANALYSIS>) == <GROUND TRUTH> and/or follows <DATA COLLECTION>, <SUMMARY>. 
          - The analysis is {failure} if the final answer of the LLM ("Final answer: ..." in <PROVIDED ANALYSIS>) != <GROUND TRUTH> and/or does not follow <DATA COLLECTION>, <SUMMARY>. 

          Evaluate the <PROVIDED ANALYSIS> using the ground truth (<GROUND TRUTH>).

          **ONLY return "{success}" or "{failure}" and not the whole answer.**

        <NOTE>
        Comprehensiveness refers to the property of a text to explore and formulate all key aspects associated with a specific topic, thus, to address all aspects of a topic or query and to aggregate all related information.

        You will receive instructions on how to proceed with the evaluation and assessment:
          - First, you receive the patient’s concern (<PATIENT>).
          - Next, you receive an expert annotated comment about what is expected from the LLM's analysis as well as you receive a key word list with the most important keywords related to the patient's concern (<DATA>).

          - Then, you receive the analysis of the patient prepared by the other LLM (<PROVIDED ANALYSIS>).
          - The, you receive the expert annotated ground truth (<GROUND TRUTH>) denoted as either "yes" or "no".
          - The analysis is {success} and complete if it addresses all or at least most of the aspects and properties given in <NOTE>, <DATA>, <DATA COLLECTION>, and <SUMMARY>. 
          - The analysis is {failure} and incomplete if it addresses no or only a few of the aspects and properties given in <NOTE>, <DATA>, <DATA COLLECTION>, and <SUMMARY>.
          - Rate the analysis as “{success}” if it is {success} and complete. Rate the analysis as “{failure}” if it is {failure} and incomplete.

          Evaluate the <PROVIDED ANALYSIS> using the data made available to you and the additional information you gathered.

          **ONLY return "{success}" or "{failure}" and not the whole answer. DO NOT return your <DATA COLLECTION> AND <SUMMARY> or any other aspect.**
